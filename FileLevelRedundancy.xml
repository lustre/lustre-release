    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para> The Lustre file system was initially designed and implemented for HPC
      use. It has been working well on high-end storage that has internal
      redundancy and fault-tolerance. However, despite the expense and
      complexity of these storage systems, storage failures still occur, and
      before release 2.11, Lustre could not be more reliable than the
      individual storage and servers’ components on which it was based. The
      Lustre file system had no mechanism to mitigate storage hardware
      failures and files would become inaccessible if a server was inaccessible
      or otherwise out of service.</para>
    <para>With the File Level Redundancy (FLR) feature introduced in Lustre
      Release 2.11, any Lustre file can store the same data on multiple OSTs in
      order for the system to be robust in the event of storage failures or
      other outages.  With the choice of multiple mirrors, the best suited
      mirror can be chosen to satisfy an individual request, which has a direct
      impact on IO availability.  Furthermore, for files that are concurrently
      read by many clients (e.g. input decks, shared libraries, or executables)
      the aggregate parallel read performance of a single file can be improved
      by creating multiple mirrors of the file data.</para>
    <para>The first phase of the FLR feature has been implemented with delayed
      write (<xref linkend="flr.delayedwrite.fig"/>). While writing to a
      mirrored file, only one primary or preferred mirror will be updated
      directly during the write, while other mirrors will be simply marked as
      stale. The file can subsequently return to a mirrored state again by
      synchronizing among mirrors with command line tools (run by the user or
      administrator directly or via automated monitoring tools).</para>

                <para>Only the <literal>prefer</literal> flag is supported at
                  this time. This flag will be set to all components that belong
                  to the corresponding mirror. The <literal>prefer</literal>
                  flag gives a hint to Lustre for which mirrors should be used
                  to serve I/O.  When a mirrored file is being read, the
                  component(s) with the <literal>prefer</literal> flag is likely
                  to be picked to serve the read; and when a mirrored file is
                  prepared to be written, the MDT will tend to choose the
                  component with the <literal>prefer</literal> flag set and
                  mark the other components with overlapping extents as stale.
                  This flag just provides a hint to Lustre, which means Lustre
                  may still choose mirrors without this flag set, for instance,
                  if all preferred mirrors are unavailable when the I/O occurs.
                  This flag can be set on multiple components.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="strong">Note:</emphasis>  This flag will
                  be set to all components that belong to the corresponding
                  mirror. The <literal>--comp-flags</literal> option also
                  exists, which can be set to individual components at mirror

      <para><emphasis role="strong">Note:</emphasis>  For redundancy and
        fault-tolerance, users need to make sure that different mirrors must
        be on different OSTs, even OSSs and racks. An understanding of cluster
        topology is necessary to achieve this architecture. In the initial
        implementation the use of the existing OST pools mechanism will allow
        separating OSTs by any arbitrary criteria:  i.e. fault domain.
        In practice, users can take advantage of OST pools by grouping OSTs
        by topological information. Therefore, when creating a mirrored file,
        users can indicate which OST pools can be used by mirrors.</para>

      <para> The first mirror has 4MB stripe size and two stripes across OSTs in

      <para>As mentioned above, it is recommended to use the
        <literal>--pool|-p</literal> option (one of the
        <literal>lfs setstripe</literal> options) with OST pools configured with
        independent fault domains to ensure different mirrors will be placed on
        different OSTs, servers, and/or racks, thereby improving availability
        and performance.  If the setstripe options are not specified, it is
        possible to create mirrors with objects on the same OST(s), which would

              write operations, and need to be resynchronized by running

          <listitem>

      do not understand a mirrored layout, they can access mirrored files
      created in Lustre 2.11 filesystem, however, they cannot open them. This is
      because the Lustre 2.10 clients do not verify overlapping components so
      they would read and write mirrored files just as if they were normal PFL
      files, which will cause a problem where synced mirrors actually contain
      different data.</para>
