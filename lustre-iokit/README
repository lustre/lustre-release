This bundle includes four tools:
In order of preference:

sgpdd-survey: - a test of the 'bare metal' performance, bypassing
as much of the kernel as we can. Does not require Lustre, does
require the sgp_dd package.  WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON DEVICE.

obdsurvey: - a test of Lustre performance with three modes:
Requires Python > 2.2
Requires Lustre

- local disk test - requires one OST
- network performance test - requires two Lustre machines
- network + disk test - requires Lustre filesystem and client

ior-survey:
A script to run the IOR benchmark. Version 2.8.6 of IOR is included

obdfilter-survey:
Obsoleted by obdsurvey, included for historical reasons, and for
systems that do not have a recent version of Python.
