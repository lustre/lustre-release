BUILDING LUSTRE
---------------

You must already have a Lustre-patched kernel, which is outside of the
scope of this document.  For more information on this process, see the
web sites below.  Also consider downloading a pre-packaged Lustre
kernel and utilities from https://downloads.hpdd.intel.com/

To build:
  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-linux=/usr/src/lustre_patched_kernel_tree
  make

To play with Lustre:
  cd tests
  sh llmount.sh

To clean up:
  sh llmountcleanup.sh
