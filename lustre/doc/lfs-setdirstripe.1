.TH LFS-SETDIRSTRIPE 1 2017-11-07 "Lustre" "Lustre Utilities"
.SH NAME
lfs setdirstripe, mkdir \- set striping pattern of a directory.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs setdirstripe [\fR-cdDHioT\fR] \fIDIR\fR...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a striped directory with specified striping pattern. This lfs utility
is similar to
.BR lfs setstripe
, but is used to create striped directory.
.B lfs mkdir
is an alias for this command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-T ", " \-\-mdt\-count =\fICOUNT\fR
Stripe the new directory over
.I COUNT
MDTs.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-mdt\-index =\fISTART_MDT_INDEX\fR
Use the MDT whose index is
.I START_MDT_INDEX
as the master/starting MDT for the directory.
.TP
.BR \-H ", " \-\-mdt-hash =\fIHASH_TYPE\fR
Use
.I hash_type
for the striped directory.
.RS 1.2i
.TP
.B fnv_1a_64
Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV-1a) hash algorithm.  This provides
reasonably uniform, but not cryptographically strong,
hashing of the filename. (default)
.TP
.B all_char
Sum of ASCII characters modulo number of MDTs. This
provides weak hashing of the filename, and is suitable
for only testing or when the input is known to have
perfectly uniform distribution (e.g. sequential numbers).
.RE
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-delete
Delete the default striping layout from the directory.  New subdirectories
created in this directory will inherit the global default directory layout
(by default they will not be striped).
.TP
.BR \-D ", " \-\-default
Set the default striping pattern of subdirectories. Newly created
sub-directories will use the new default striping pattern,
but existing sub-directories will not be affected.  The newly
created sub-directories will also inherit the specified default
striping pattern. Only default stripe count is supported for now.

Note that striping all directories across all MDTs by default is not
recommended at this time, as the clients will have to do more RPCs to
create and access each directory, hurting performance rather than
improving it.  Default striped directories are preferred for cases
where large subdirectories will be created (e.g. file-per-process
job output directories).
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-mode =\fIMODE\fR
Set the file access permissions of the new directory to the specified
numeric
.I MODE
(typically octal), as with
.BR chmod (1).
It is not affected by the current
.BR umask (1p).
.SH NOTE
.PP
The
.B lfs setdirstripe
command is only executable by root unless
.B "mdt.*.enable_remote_dir_gid"
is set on the MDS via
.B lctl set_param
to be either a non-zero GID to limit it to a single group
(e.g. "operator" or "admin"), or "-1" to allow any group
to create remote directories.

The root of the file system is on MDT0000, and directories and files inherit the
MDT of their parent directory unless a different MDT is specified with this
command.

By default, only directories on MDT0000 can contain directories that are not on
the same MDT.  However, if "mdt.*.enable_remote_dir" is set non-zero on an MDT
then it will allow creating remote directories that have parents other than
MDT0000. This is restricted to avoid creating directory trees that have
intermediate path components on a series different MDTs and become unavailable
if any of the intermediate MDTs are offline.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs setdirstripe -c 2 -i 1 -H all_char /mnt/lustre/dir1
This creates a directory striped on two MDTs, whose first stripe is on
.B MDT0001
(MDT index 1), and whose hash type is
.BR all_char .
.SH AVAILABILITY
The
.B lfs setdirstripe
command is part of the Lustre filesystem.
