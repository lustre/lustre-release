.SH NAME
lfs mirror split \- split a specified mirror from an existing mirrored file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs mirror split
<\fB\-\-mirror\-id\fR <\fImirror_id\fR>>
[\fB\-\-destroy\fR|\fB\-d\fR]
[\fB\-f\fR <\fInew_file\fR>]
<\fImirrored_file\fR>
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command splits a mirror with ID <\fImirror_id\fR> out of a mirrored
file specified by the path name \fImirrored_file\fR. By default, the layout of
the split mirror will be stored into a new file named
<\fImirrored_file\fR>.mirror~<\fImirror_id\fR>. If \fB\-\-destroy\fR|\fB\-d\fR
option is specified, then the split mirror will be destroyed.
If \fB\-f\fR <\fInew_file\fR> option is specified, then the layout of the split
mirror will be stored into the named file.
.br
If \fImirrored_file\fR has only one mirror existing after split, it will be
converted to a regular non-mirrored file.
.br
If the original \fImirrored_file\fR is not a mirrored file, then the command
will return an error.
