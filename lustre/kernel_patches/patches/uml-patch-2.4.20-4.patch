+  The Ethertap Transport is preferred over slip because of its
+  limitations.  If you prefer slip, however, say Y here.  Otherwise
   choose the Multicast transport (to network multiple UMLs on 
   multiple hosts), Ethertap (to network with the host and the
   outside world), and/or the Daemon transport (to network multiple
   UMLs on a single host).  You may choose more than one without
   conflict.  If you don't need UML networking, say N.
+
+SLiRP transport
+CONFIG_UML_NET_SLIRP
+  The SLiRP User-Mode Linux network transport allows a running UML
+  to network by invoking a program that can handle SLIP encapsulated
+  packets.  This is commonly (but not limited to) the application
+  known as SLiRP, a program that can re-socket IP packets back onto
+  the host on which it is run.  Only IP packets are supported,
+  unlike other network transports that can handle all Ethernet
+  frames.  In general, slirp allows the UML the same IP connectivity
+  to the outside world that the host user is permitted, and unlike
+  other transports, SLiRP works without the need of root level
+  privleges, setuid binaries, or SLIP devices on the host.  This
+  also means not every type of connection is possible, but most
+  situations can be accomodated with carefully crafted slirp
+  commands that can be passed along as part of the network device's
+  setup string.  The effect of this transport on the UML is similar
+  that of a host behind a firewall that masquerades all network
+  connections passing through it (but is less secure).
+
+  To use this you should first have slirp compiled somewhere
+  accessible on the host, and have read its documentation.  If you
+  don't need UML networking, say N.
+
+  Startup example: "eth0=slirp,FE:FD:01:02:03:04,/usr/local/bin/slirp"
+
+Default main console channel initialization
+CONFIG_CON_ZERO_CHAN
+  This is the string describing the channel to which the main console
+  will be attached by default.  This value can be overridden from the
+  command line.  The default value is "fd:0,fd:1", which attaches the
+  main console to stdin and stdout.
+  It is safe to leave this unchanged.
+
+Default console channel initialization
+CONFIG_CON_CHAN
+  This is the string describing the channel to which all consoles
+  except the main console will be attached by default.  This value can
+  be overridden from the command line.  The default value is "xterm",
+  which brings them up in xterms.
+  It is safe to leave this unchanged, although you may wish to change
+  this if you expect the UML that you build to be run in environments
+  which don't have X or xterm available.
+
+Default serial line channel initialization
+CONFIG_SSL_CHAN
+  This is the string describing the channel to which the serial lines
+  will be attached by default.  This value can be overridden from the
+  command line.  The default value is "pty", which attaches them to
+  traditional pseudo-terminals.
+  It is safe to leave this unchanged, although you may wish to change
+  this if you expect the UML that you build to be run in environments
+  which don't have a set of /dev/pty* devices.
+
+Nesting level
+CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL
+  This is set to the number of layers of UMLs that this UML will be run
+  in.  Normally, this is zero, meaning that it will run directly on the
+  host.  Setting it to one will build a UML that can run inside a UML
+  that is running on the host.  Generally, if you intend this UML to run
+  inside another UML, set CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL to one more than the host UML.
+  Note that if the hosting UML has its CONFIG_KERNEL_HALF_GIGS set to 
+  greater than one, then the guest UML should have its CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL 
+  set to the host's CONFIG_NEST_LEVEL + CONFIG_KERNEL_HALF_GIGS.
+  Only change this if you are running nested UMLs.
+
+Kernel address space size (in .5G units)
+CONFIG_KERNEL_HALF_GIGS
+  This determines the amount of address space that UML will allocate for
+  its own, measured in half Gigabyte units.  The default is 1.
+  Change this only if you need to boot UML with an unusually large amount
+  of physical memory.
+
+UML sound support
+CONFIG_UML_SOUND
+  This option enables UML sound support.  If enabled, it will pull in
+  soundcore and the UML hostaudio relay, which acts as a intermediary
+  between the host's dsp and mixer devices and the UML sound system.
+  It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+UML SMP support
+CONFIG_UML_SMP
+  This option enables UML SMP support.  UML implements virtual SMP by
+  allowing as many processes to run simultaneously on the host as
+  there are virtual processors configured.  Obviously, if the host is
+  a uniprocessor, those processes will timeshare, but, inside UML,
+  will appear to be running simultaneously.  If the host is a
+  multiprocessor, then UML processes may run simultaneously, depending
+  on the host scheduler.
+  CONFIG_SMP will be set to whatever this option is set to.
+  It is safe to leave this unchanged.
+
+file descriptor channel support
+CONFIG_FD_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to already set up file descriptors.  Generally, the main
+  console is attached to file descriptors 0 and 1 (stdin and stdout),
+  so it would be wise to leave this enabled unless you intend to
+  attach it to some other host device.
+
+null device channel support
+CONFIG_NULL_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to a device similar to /dev/null.  Data written to it disappears
+  and there is never any data to be read.
+
+port channel support
+CONFIG_PORT_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to host portals.  They may be accessed with 'telnet <host>
+  <port number>'.  Any number of consoles and serial lines may be
+  attached to a single portal, although what UML device you get when
+  you telnet to that portal will be unpredictable.
+  It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+pty channel support
+CONFIG_PTY_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to host pseudo-terminals.  Access to both traditional
+  pseudo-terminals (/dev/pty*) and pts pseudo-terminals are controlled
+  with this option.  The assignment of UML devices to host devices
+  will be announced in the kernel message log.
+  It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+tty channel support
+CONFIG_TTY_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to host terminals.  Access to both virtual consoles
+  (/dev/tty*) and the slave side of pseudo-terminals (/dev/ttyp* and
+  /dev/pts/*) are controlled by this option.
+  It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+xterm channel support
+CONFIG_XTERM_CHAN
+  This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
+  lines to xterms.  Each UML device so assigned will be brought up in
+  its own xterm.
+  If you disable this option, then CONFIG_PT_PROXY will be disabled as
+  well, since UML's gdb currently requires an xterm.
+  It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+tty logging
+CONFIG_TTY_LOG
+  This option enables logging of all data going through pseudo-terminals
+  to the host.  This is primarily useful for honeypots, where you want
+  secure keystroke logging that can't be detected or disabled by root.
+  Say 'N' unless you are setting up a UML honeypot or otherwise know that
+  you want this option.
