#     Alexander Nyberg/Andi/Sergey: Fix x86 "clear_cpu()" macro.
#   
#   Linus's 2.6 changelog:
#                                                                                         
#   Fix x86 "clear_cpu()" macro.
#                                                                                         
#   We need to clear all exceptions before synchronizing
#   with the FPU, since we aren't ready to handle a FP
#   exception here and we're getting rid of all FP state.
#                                                                                         
#   Special thanks to Alexander Nyberg for reports and
#   testing. Alternate patches by Sergey Vlasov and Andi
#   Kleen, who both worked on this.
#
