# Configuration options for /etc/init.d/lustre

# The command in PREEXEC_SCRIPT is run before starting services.  Its first
# parameter is mode of the init script (start|restart|condrestart).  If the
# command has a non-zero return code, then the init script will abort without
# taking any action.
#PREEXEC_SCRIPT="/usr/bin/somescript"

# The command in PREEXEC_CHECK is run before starting services.  It is not
# passed any arguments.  If the command has a non-zero return code, then the
# init script will abort without taking any action.
#PREEXEC_CHECK="command"

# The commands in POSTEXEC_SCRIPT and/or POSTEXEC_CHECK are run after starting
# services.  If the command has a non-zero return code, then the init script
# will terminate with an exit status of 1.
#POSTEXEC_SCRIPT="/usr/bin/somescript"
#POSTEXEC_CHECK="command"

# If SCSI_DEVICE_TIMEOUT is set, its value is echoed into
#  /sys/block/sdXX/device/timeout
# before checking file systems or starting Lustre
#SCSI_DEVICE_TIMEOUT=60

# LOCAL_SRV or FOREIGN_SRV can be set to a space-delimited list of
# labels that will be mounted as local and foreign (failover) lustre services.
# If unset or null, /etc/ldev.conf establishes the labels for these services.
#LOCAL_SRV="`shopt -s nullglob && cd /dev/disk/by-label 2>/dev/null && echo *-OST* *-MDT* *MGS* *MGT*`"

# Before mounting any lustre backend devices, the init script will
# run pfsck.ldiskfs only if the following FSCK_ARGS variable is a
# non-empty string.  There are no default options for this fsck.
# The command takes the form:
#
#     /sbin/pfsck.ldiskfs $devices -- ${FSCK_ARGS}
#
#FSCK_ARGS="-p"

# By default the init script will check ldiskfs filesystems using
# /sbin/fsck.ldiskfs if it exists, otherwise it will use /sbin/fsck.
# Set the PFSCK variable here to override that behavior.  The value must
# be an absolute path.
#
#PFSCK=/sbin/fsck

# By default the init script will test ldiskfs feature flags using
# /sbin/tunefs.ldiskfs if it exists, otherwise it will use
# /sbin/tune2fs.  Set the TUNE2FS variable here to override that
# behavior.  The value must be an absolute path.
#
#TUNE2FS=/sbin/tune2fs

# Uncomment to insert server mount options - see mount.lustre(8)
#MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o abort_recov"

# Stagger mounts by MOUNT_DELAY seconds to avoid possible module loading races
# due to multiple mount commands running in parallel.  This obviously does not
# eliminate the race but provides a safety buffer.  The default is 2 seconds.
# Set to 0 or empty string to disable staggering of mounts.
#MOUNT_DELAY=0

# Uncomment to disable the check for the mmp ldiskfs feature (only
# applies if foreign # devices are configured).
# REQUIRE_MMP_FEATURE=no

# Override default mount points for lustre services
#LOCAL_MOUNT_DIR=/mnt/lustre/local
#FOREIGN_MOUNT_DIR=/mnt/lustre/foreign

# Uncomment to cause the lustre init scripts to explicitly modprobe the zfs
# module when starting services.  The zfs module is normally loaded
# automatically by the zfs command line utilities, for example when the zpool
# is imported.
#LOAD_ZFS="yes"

# Uncomment to pass additional arguments to 'zpool import'.  For example,
# the -m option can be used to allow the pool to be imported even if its
# missing a non-critical log device.
#ZPOOL_IMPORT_ARGS="-m"

# Uncomment to force ZFS to import the pool using the device names in the
# given directory.  By default, the /dev/disk/by-vdev/ device names will be
# used if they are configured followed by the /dev/mapper device names.
#ZPOOL_IMPORT_DIR="/dev/disk/by-id"
