# Currently it isn't possible to auto-tune the o2iblnd parameters optimally
# inside the kernel since the OFED API hides the details from us.
# Unfortunately, there isn't a single set of parameters that provide optimal
# performance on different HCA/HFI types. This file provides optimized
# tunables for the OPA cards.
#
# ** Please note that the below settings are the recommended settings only for
#    OPA cards. If other IB cards are also present along with OPA cards then
#    these settings will be applied across all the configured IB interfaces.
#
# Card detection and tunable selection is handled via /usr/sbin/ko2iblnd-probe
# at runtime when the ko2iblnd module is installed, either at boot or when
# Lustre is first mounted.
