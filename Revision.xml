    <para>Note that the <emphasis role="italic">Lustre* Operations Manual 2.x</emphasis>  is
        intended to be relevant for all 2.x releases of the Lustre software. Most of the manual
        content is relevant to all of the releases. However, any features and content that are added
        for new versions of the Lustre software are clearly marked with the version in which this
        functionality is added. Similarly, features that are no longer available  are marked with
        the version in which they were deprecated or removed. <revhistory>
