    <para>The <emphasis role="italic">Lustre Software Release 2.x Operations Manual</emphasis>
        contains content relevant for all 2.x releases of the Lustre software. <note>
            <para>Updates to the manual are made as the changes become available.  When features are
                added with new releases of the Lustre software, they are clearly marked with the
                version of the release in which the functionality was added. Features that are
                deprecated by a release or removed from the software are also marked with the
                version of the release in which they became deprecated or were removed.</para>
