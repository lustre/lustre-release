    Using ACLs</title>
    <para>An access control list (ACL), is a set of data that informs an
      operating system about permissions or access rights that each user or
      group has to specific system objects, such as directories or files. Each
      object has a unique security attribute that identifies users who have
      access to it. The ACL lists each object and user access privileges such as
      read, write or execute.</para>

        how they work</secondary></indexterm>How ACLs Work</title>
      <para>Implementing ACLs varies between operating systems. Systems that
        support the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) family of
        standards share a simple yet powerful file system permission model,
        which should be well-known to the Linux/UNIX administrator. ACLs add
        finer-grained permissions to this model, allowing for more complicated
        permission schemes. For a detailed explanation of ACLs on a Linux
        operating system, refer to the SUSE Labs article
        <link xl:href="https://www.usenix.org/legacyurl/posix-access-control-lists-linux">
          Posix Access Control Lists on Linux</link>.</para>
      <para>We have implemented ACLs according to this model. The Lustre
        software works with the standard Linux ACL tools, setfacl, getfacl, and
        the historical chacl, normally installed with the ACL package.</para>
      <note>
        <para>ACL support is a system-range feature, meaning that all clients
          have ACL enabled or not. You cannot specify which clients should
          enable ACL.</para>

      </indexterm>Using ACLs with the Lustre Software</title>
      <para>POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be used with the Lustre
        software. An ACL consists of file entries representing permissions based
        on standard POSIX file system object permissions that define three
        classes of user (owner, group and other). Each class is associated with
        a set of permissions [read (r), write (w) and execute (x)].</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Owner class permissions define access privileges of the file
            owner.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Group class permissions define access privileges of the owning
            group.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Other class permissions define access privileges of all users
            not in the owner or group class.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The <literal>ls -l</literal> command displays the owner, group, and
        other class permissions in the first column of its output (for example,
        <literal>-rw-r- --</literal> for a regular file with read and write
        access for the owner class, read access for the group class, and no
        access for others).</para>
      <para>Minimal ACLs have three entries. Extended ACLs have more than the
        three entries. Extended ACLs also contain a mask entry and may contain
        any number of named user and named group entries.</para>
      <para>To check ACLs on the MDS, check that the <literal>acl</literal>
        connect flag is listed (default since Lustre 1.8):</para>
      <screen>
# lctl get_param -n mdc.home-MDT0000-mdc-*.connect_flags | grep acl
      </screen>
      <para>ACLs are enabled by default on a Lustre file system, and are
        controlled on a system-wide basis; either all clients enable ACLs or
        none do.  Activating ACLs is controlled by MDS mount options
        <literal>acl</literal>/<literal>noacl</literal> to enable or disable
        ACLs, respectively.  You do not need to change the client
        configuration, and the <literal>acl</literal> string will not appear
        in the client mount options in <literal>/etc/mtab</literal>. 
      </para>
      <para>If ACLs are not enabled on the MDS, then any attempts to reference
        an ACL on a client return an <literal>Operation not supported</literal>
        error.

      <primary>root squash</primary>
    </indexterm>Using Root Squash</title>
    <para>Root squash is a security feature which restricts super-user access
      rights to a Lustre file system. Without the root squash feature enabled,
      Lustre file system users on untrusted clients could access or modify files
      owned by root on the file system, including deleting them. Using the root
      squash feature restricts file access/modifications as the root user.
      Note, however, that this does <emphasis>not</emphasis> prevent users
      from accessing files owned by <emphasis>other</emphasis> users.</para>
    <para>The root squash feature works by re-mapping the user ID (UID) and
      group ID (GID) of the root user to a UID and GID specified by the system
      administrator. The preferred way to configure root squash is via nodemaps
      and the <literal>admin</literal> property. Nodemaps allow root squash on a
      per-client basis. With UID maps, the clients can even have a local root
      UID without actually having root access to the filesystem itself.
    </para>
    <para>Please refer to explanations about the <literal>admin</literal>
      property in the chapter dedicated to Nodemaps, in
      <xref linkend="lustrenodemap.alteringproperties.managing" />.

  <section xml:id="managingSecurity.isolation">
    <title><indexterm><primary>Isolation</primary></indexterm>
    Isolating Clients to a Sub-directory Tree</title>
    <para>Isolation is the Lustre implementation of the generic concept of
      multi-tenancy, which aims at providing separated namespaces from a single
      filesystem. Lustre Isolation enables different populations of users on
      the same file system beyond normal Unix permissions/ACLs, even when users
      on the clients may have root access. Those tenants share the same file
      system, but they are isolated from each other: they cannot access or even
      see each other&apos;s files, and are not aware that they are sharing
      common file system resources.</para>
    <para>Lustre Isolation leverages the Fileset feature
      (<xref linkend="SystemConfigurationUtilities.fileset" />)
      to mount only a subdirectory of the filesystem rather than the root
      directory.
      In order to achieve isolation, the subdirectory mount, which presents to
      tenants only their own fileset, has to be imposed to the clients. To that
      extent, we make use of the nodemap feature
      (<xref linkend="lustrenodemap.title" />). We group all clients used by a
      tenant under a common nodemap entry, and we assign to this nodemap entry
      the fileset to which the tenant is restricted.</para>

      <title><indexterm><primary>Isolation</primary><secondary>
        client identification</secondary></indexterm>Identifying Clients</title>
      <para>Enforcing multi-tenancy on Lustre relies on the ability to properly
        identify the client nodes used by a tenant, and trust those identities.
        This can be achieved by having physical hardware and/or network
        security, so that client nodes have well-known NIDs. It is also possible
        to make use of strong authentication with Kerberos or Shared-Secret Key
        (see <xref linkend="lustressk" />).
        Kerberos prevents NID spoofing, as every client needs its own
        credentials, based on its NID, in order to connect to the servers.
        Shared-Secret Key also prevents tenant impersonation, because keys
        can be linked to a specific nodemap. See
        <xref linkend="ssknodemaprole" /> for detailed explanations.

      <para>Isolation on Lustre can be achieved by setting the
        <literal>fileset</literal> parameter on a nodemap entry. All clients
        belonging to this nodemap entry will automatically mount this fileset
        instead of the root directory. For example:</para>
      <screen>mgs# lctl nodemap_set_fileset --name tenant1 --fileset '/dir1'</screen>
      <para>So all clients matching the <literal>tenant1</literal> nodemap will
        be automatically presented the fileset <literal>/dir1</literal> when
        mounting. This means these clients are doing an implicit subdirectory
        mount on the subdirectory <literal>/dir1</literal>.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If subdirectory defined as fileset does not exist on the file system,
          it will prevent any client belonging to the nodemap from mounting
          Lustre.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>To delete the fileset parameter, just set it to an empty string:

      <para>In order to make isolation permanent, the fileset parameter on the

    <title><indexterm><primary>selinux policy check</primary></indexterm>
    Checking SELinux Policy Enforced by Lustre Clients</title>
    <para>SELinux provides a mechanism in Linux for supporting Mandatory Access
      Control (MAC) policies. When a MAC policy is enforced, the operating
      system&apos;s (OS) kernel defines application rights,
      firewalling applications from compromising the entire system.
      Regular users do not have the ability to override the policy.</para>
    <para>One purpose of SELinux is to protect the
      <emphasis role="bold">OS</emphasis> from privilege escalation. To that
      extent, SELinux defines confined and unconfined domains for processes and
      users. Each process, user, file is assigned a security context, and
      rules define the allowed operations by processes and users on files.
    </para>
    <para>Another purpose of SELinux can be to protect
      <emphasis role="bold">data</emphasis> sensitivity, thanks to Multi-Level
      Security (MLS). MLS works on top of SELinux, by defining the concept of
      security levels in addition to domains. Each process, user and file is
      assigned a security level, and the model states that processes and users
      can read the same or lower security level, but can only write to their own
      or higher security level.
    </para>
    <para>From a file system perspective, the security context of files must be
      stored permanently. Lustre makes use of the
      <literal>security.selinux</literal> extended attributes on files to hold
      this information. Lustre supports SELinux on the client side. All you have
      to do to have MAC and MLS on Lustre is to enforce the appropriate SELinux
      policy (as provided by the Linux distribution) on all Lustre clients. No
      SELinux is required on Lustre servers.
    </para>
    <para>Because Lustre is a distributed file system, the specificity when
      using MLS is that Lustre really needs to make sure data is always accessed
      by nodes with the SELinux MLS policy properly enforced. Otherwise, data is
      not protected. This means Lustre has to check that SELinux is properly
      enforced on client side, with the right, unaltered policy. And if SELinux
      is not enforced as expected on a client, the server denies its access to
      Lustre.

      <para>SELinux policy check can be enforced by setting the

      <warning><para condition='l2F'>When Lustre client is built against the
       embedded kernel library instead of the in-kernel fscrypt, the ability to
       encrypt file and directory names is governed by new llite parameter named
       <literal>enable_filename_encryption</literal>, introduced in 2.15, and
       set to 0 by default.
       When this parameter is 0, new empty directories configured as encrypted
       use content encryption only, and not name encryption. This mode is
       inherited for all subdirectories and files.
       When <literal>enable_filename_encryption</literal> parameter is set to 1,
       new empty directories configured as encrypted use full encryption
       capabilities by encrypting file content and also file and directory
       names. This mode is inherited for all subdirectories and files.
       To set the <literal>enable_filename_encryption</literal> parameter
       globally for all clients, one can do on the MGS:
<screen>mgs# lctl set_param -P llite.*.enable_filename_encryption=1</screen>
       Be aware that the <literal>enable_filename_encryption</literal> tuning
       parameter is not available when Lustre client is built against in-kernel

       encrypted, they will remain so after upgrade to 2.15. To benefit from
       name encryption for an old directory previously created with Lustre 2.14,

      <title>What Is Kerberos?</title>
      <para>Kerberos is a mechanism for authenticating all entities (such as
        users and servers) on an &quot;unsafe&quot; network. Each of these
        entities, known as &quot;principals&quot;, negotiate a runtime key with
        the Kerberos server. This key enables principals to verify that messages
        from the Kerberos server are authentic. By trusting the Kerberos server,
        users and services can authenticate one another.</para>
      <para>Setting up Lustre with Kerberos can provide advanced security
        protections for the Lustre network. Broadly, Kerberos offers three types
        of benefit:</para>

          Security flavors can be set by defining sptlrpc rules on the MGS.

                Before you change a rule, make sure affected nodes are ready

                but GSS/Kerberos environment is not properly configured on
                affected nodes, those nodes might be evicted because they cannot
                communicate with each other.

      <para>
        Each node can specify which flavor to use to connect to the MGS, by
        using the <literal>mgssec=flavor</literal> mount option.
        Once a flavor is chosen, it cannot be changed until re-mount.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because a Lustre node only has one connection to the MGS, if there is
        more than one target or client on the node, they necessarily use the
        same security flavor to the MGS, being the one enforced when the first
        connection to the MGS was established.

      <para>
        By default, the MGS accepts RPCs with any flavor. But it is possible to
        configure the MGS to only accept a given flavor. The syntax is identical
