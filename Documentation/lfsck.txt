LFSCK: an online file system checker for Lustre
===============================================

LFSCK is an online tool to scan, check and repair a Lustre file system that can
be used with a file system that is mounted and in use. It contains three main
LFSCK components: OI Scrub (primarily of use for ldiskfs-based backend), Layout
LFSCK, and Namespace LFSCK. Each component identifies different types of Lustre
inconsistencies.

LFSCK does not verify the on-disk format and assumes that it is consistent. For
ldiskfs-based backend, e2fsck from e2fsprogs should be used to ensure the on
disk format is consistent. ZFS is designed to always have a valid on-disk
structure and as a result, no 'fsck' is necessary.

* OI Scrub

OI scrub is of primary use for ldiskfs-based targets. It maintains the ldiskfs
special OI mapping consistency, reconstructs the OI mapping after the target
is restored from file-level backup or is otherwise corrupted, and upgrades
(if necessary) the OI mapping when target (MDT/OST) is upgraded from a
previous release.

* Layout LFSCK

Layout LFSCK is concerned with consistency between metadata targets (MDTs) and
object storage targets (OSTs). It automatically corrects inconsistencies where
possible.

* Namespace LFSCK

Namespace LFSCK is concerned with consistency across the Lustre namespace.
Namespace LFSCK works transparently across single and multiple MDTs.

Quick usage instructions
===============================================

*** Start LFSCK ***

If you want all LFSCK checks to be run on all MDTs and OSTs, run on MDT0000:
# lctl lfsck_start -M $FSNAME-$TARGETNAME -A -t all -r

(FSNAME: the specified file system name created during format, e.g. "testfs".
 TARGETNAME: the target name in the system, e.g. "MDT0000" or "OST0001".)

If you want OI Scrub only on one MDT or OST, use this command on the MDT/OST:
# lctl lfsck_start -t scrub -M $FSNAME-$TARGETNAME

If you want LFSCK Layout or LFSCK Namespace on the given MDT(s), use:
# lctl lfsck_start -t namespace -M $FSNAME-$MDTNAME
or
# lctl lfsck_start -t layout -M $FSNAME-$MDTNAME

(MDTNAME: the MDT name in the system, e.g. "MDT0000", "MDT0001".)

You can trigger multiple LFSCK components via single LFSCK command:
# lctl lfsck_start -t namespace -t layout -M $FSNAME-$MDTNAME

For more usage, please run:
# lctl lfsck_start -h

*** Check the status of LFSCK ***

By default LFSCK logs all operations to the Lustre internal debug
log, which can be dumped to a file on each server with:
# lctl debug_kernel /tmp/debug.lfsck

However, since the internal debug log is of limited size, it is
possible to dump lfsck logs to the console for capture with syslog. 
# lctl set_param printk=+lfsck

Another option is to dump the LFSCK logs to a file directly from the
kernel, which is more efficient than logging to the console if there
are lots of repairs needed (e.g. after a filesystem upgrade or if the
OI files are lost).  The following command should be run on all MDS
and OSS nodes to generate a log file (maximum 1024MB in size):
# lctl debug_daemon start /tmp/debug.lfsck 1024

Each LFSCK component has its own status interface on a given target.
It is possible to monitor the LFSCK status on the local node via:
# lctl lfsck_query -M $FSNAME-$TARGET

It is also possible to get type-specific status, for example on
the Namespace LFSCK status on the MDT:
# lctl get_param -n mdd.$FSNAME-$MDTNAME.lfsck_namespace

Or the Layout LFSCK status on the OST:
# lctl get_param -n obdfilter.$FSNAME-$OSTNAME.lfsck_layout
NOTE: Layout LFSCK also works on a OST.

(OSTNAME: the OST name in the system, e.g. "OST0000", "OST0001".)

Or the OI Scrub status on the underlying ldiskfs MDT/OST:
# lctl get_param -n osd-ldiskfs.$FSNAME-$TARGETNAME.oi_scrub

*** Stop the currently running LFSCK ***

Run the command on the given MDT/OST:
# lctl lfsck_stop -M $FSNAME-$MDTNAME

To stop all LFSCK across the system:
# lctl lfsck_stop -M $FSNAME -A


LFSCK Features Overview
===============================================

* online scanning.
* control of scanning rate.
* automatic checkpoint recovery of an interrupted scan.
* monitoring using proc and lctl interfaces.
* maintain OI mapping for ldiskfs-based backend.
  * reconstruction of the OI mapping after the target (MDT/OST) restored from
    file-level backup.
  * generate OI mapping for the MDT upgraded from 1.8.
  * rebuild OI mapping if some of them lost or crashed.
* check and repair kinds of namespace related inconsistent issues:
  * the FID-in-dirent should be consistent with the FID-in-LMA.
  * the linkEA should be consistent with related name entries.
  * Dangling name entry: the name entry exists, but related MDT-object does
    not exist.
  * Orphan MDT-object: the MDT-object exists, but there is no name entry to
    reference it.
  * Multiple-referenced name entry: more than one MDT-objects point back to
    the same name entry, but the name entry only references one of them.
  * Unmatched name entry and MDT-object pairs: the name entry references the
    MDT-object that has no linkEA for back-reference or points back to another
    name entry that does not exist or does not reference the MDT-object.
  * Unmatched object types: the file type in the name entry does not match the
    type that is claimed by the MDT-object.
  * Invalid nlink count: the MDT-object's nlink count does not match the number
    of name entries that reference such MDT-object.
  * Invalid name hash for striped directory: the name hash for the name entry
    on a shard of a striped directory does not match the index stored in the
    shard's LMV xattr.
* verify layout consistency between MDT and OST:
  * MDT-object with dangling reference: the MDT-object1 claims that the
    OST-object1 is its child stripe, but on the OST, the OST-object1 does not
    exist, or it is not materialized (so does not recognize the MDT-object1 as
    its parent).
  * Unmatched referenced MDT-object/OST-object pairs: the MDT-object1 claims
    that the OST-object1 is its child stripe, but the OST-object1 claims that
    its parent is the MDT-object2 rather than the MDT-object1. On the MDT,
    the MDT-object2 does not exist, or not recognize the OST-object1 as its
    child stripe. An additional case exists where the child index stored in
    the parent layout information does not match the index information stored
    in the child itself.
  * Multiple referenced OST-object: the MDT-object1 claims that the OST-object1
    is its child stripe, but the OST-object1 claims that its parent is the
    MDT-object2 rather than the MDT-object1. On the other hand, the MDT-object2
    recognizes the OST-object1 as its child stripe.
  * Unreferenced (orphan) OST-object: the OST-object1 claims that the
    MDT-object1 is its parent, but on the MDT, the MDT-object1 does not exist,
    or it does not recognize the OST-object1 as its child.

    osd-ldiskfs.$FSNAME-$TARGETNAME.oi_scrub


LFSCK master slave design
===============================================

*** Master Engine ***

The LFSCK master engine resides on each MDT, and is implemented as a kernel
thread in the LFSCK layer. The master engine is responsible for scanning on the
MDTs and also controls slave engines on OSTs. Scanning on both MDTs and OSTs
occurs in two stages. First-stage scanning will identify and resolve most of
inconsistencies. In the second stage, information from the first stage will be
used to resolve a remaining set of inconsistencies that had uncertain
resolution after only one scan.


1. The master engine is started either by the user space command or an
excessive number of inconsistency events are detected (defined by
osd-ldiskfs.<fsname>-<targetname>.full_scrub_threshold_rate). On starting, the
master engine sends RPCs to other MDTs (when necessary) to start other master
engines and to related OSTs to start the slave engines.

2. The master engine on the MDS scans the MDT device using namespace iteration
(described below). For each striped file, it calls the registered LFSCK process
handlers to perform the relevant system consistency checks/repairs, which are
enumerated in the 'features' section. All objects on OSTs that are never
referenced during this scan (because, for example, they are orphans) are
recorded in an OST orphan object index on each OST.

3. After the MDT completes first-stage system scanning, the master engine sends
RPCs to related LFSCK engines on other targets to notify that the first-stage
scanning is complete on this MDT. The MDT waits until related targets have
completed the first-stage scanning. At this point, the first stage scanning is
complete and the second-stage scanning begins.

*** Slave Engine ***

The LFSCK slave engine resides on each OST and is implemented as a kernel
thread in the LFSCK layer. This kernel thread drives the first-stage system
scan on the OST.

1. When the slave engine is triggered by the RPC from the master engine in the
first-stage scanning, the OST scans the local OST device to generate the
in-memory OST orphan object index.

2. When the first-stage scanning (for both MDTs and OSTs) is complete a list of
non-referenced OST-objects has been accumulated. Only objects that are not
accessed during the first stage scan are regarded as potential orphans.

3. In the second-stage scanning, the OSTs work to resolve orphan objects in the
file system. The OST orphan object index is used as input to the second stage.
For each item in the index, the presence of a parent MDT object is verified.
Orphan objects will either be relinked to an existing file if found - or moved
into a new file in .lustre/lost+found.

If multiple MDTs are present, MDTs will check/repair MDT-OST consistency in
parallel. To avoid redundant scans of the OST device the slave engine will not
begin second-stage system scans until all the master engines complete the
first-stage system scan. For each OST there is a single OST orphan object
index, regardless of how many MDTs are in the MDT-OST consistency check/repair.


Object traversal design reference
===============================================

Objects are traversed by LFSCK with two methods: object-table based iteration
and namespace based directory traversal.

*** Object-table Based Iteration ***

The Object Storage Device (OSD) is the abstract layer above a concrete backend
file system (i.e. ldiskfs, ZFS, Btrfs, etc.). Each OSD implementation differs
internally to support concrete file systems. The object-table based iteration
is implemented inside the OSD. It uses the backend special efficient scanning
method, such as linear scanning for ldiskfs backend, to scan the local device.
Such iteration is presented via the OSD API as a virtual index that contains
all the objects that reside on this target.

*** Namespace Based Directory Traversal ***

In addition to object-table based iteration, there are directory based items
that need scanning for namespace consistency. For example, FID-in-dirent and
LinkEA are directory based features.

A naive approach to namespace traversal would be to descend recursively from
the file system root. However, this approach will typically generate random IO,
which for performance reasons should be minimized. In addition, one must
consider operations (i.e. rename) taking place within a directory that is
currently being scanned. For these reasons a hybrid approach to scanning is
employed.

1. LFSCK begins object-table based iteration.

2. If a directory is discovered then namespace traversal begins. LFSCK reads
the entries of the directory to verify and repair filename->FID mappings, but
does not descend into sub-directories.  LFSCK ignores rename operations during
the directory traversal because the subsequent object-table based iteration
will guarantee processing of renamed objects. Reading directory blocks is a
small fraction of the data needed for the objects they reference. In addition,
entries in the directory are typically allocated following the directory
object on the disk so for many directories the children objects will already
be available because of pre-fetch.

3. Process each entry in the directory checking the FID-in-dirent and the FID
in the object LMA are consistent. Repair if inconsistent. Check also that the
linkEA points back to the parent object. Check also that '.' and '..' entries
of the directory itself are consistent.

4. Once all directory entries are exhausted, return to object-table based
iteration.

Glossary of terms
===============================================

FID - File IDentifier. A Lustre file system identifies every file and object
  with a unique 128-bit ID.

FID-in-dirent - FID in Directory Entry. To enhance the performance of readdir,
  the FID of a file is recorded in its directory name entry.

linkEA - Link Extended Attributes. When a file is created or hard-linked the
  parent directory name and FID are recorded as extended attributes to the file.

LMA - Lustre Metadata Attributes. A record of Lustre specific attributes, for
  example HSM state, self-FID, and so on.

OI - Object Index. A table that maps FIDs to inodes. On ldiskfs-based targets,
  this table must be regenerated if a file level restore is performed as inodes
  will change.

OSD - Object storage device. A generic term for a storage device with an
  interface that extends beyond a block-oriented device interface.
