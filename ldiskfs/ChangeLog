       * version 4.0.1

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15320
Description: OSS crashes frequently, e2fsck does not fix
Details    : Add an extra check to ldiskfs extents code for the condition, 
             eh_entries = 0 & eh_depth != 0

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15459
Description: migrate ldiskfs - ldiskfs2 (extents on directories)
Details    : disable preallocation for non-regular files.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 13164
Description: statfs speedup patches.
Details    : The patches improve statfs performance for very large
	     filesystems.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 14596
Description: deadlock in ext3_expand_extra_isize
Details    : Inode expansion during ext3_mark_inode_dirty may lead to deadlock.
	     This is solved by making sure that ext3_expand_extra_isize isn't
	     called from ext3_xattr_set_handle.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 14493
Description: Kernel BUG at ... ldiskfs/ldiskfs/mballoc.c:3853
Details    : Removing the underlying device (e.g. via a SCSI rescan) can cause a
	     kernel BUG in ldiskfs_mb_discard_inode_preallocations().

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 14594
Description: soft lockups on 1.6.2 MDS (is_subdir)
Details    : don't add dentries with ".." to dcache and ignore such dentries in
	     iopen_lookup().

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : blocks per group is less than blocksize*8 and uninit_groups is enabled
Bugzilla   : 15932
Description: ldiskfs error: XXX blocks in bitmap, YYY in gd
Details    : If blocks per group is less than blocksize*8, set rest of the
             bitmap to 1.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10555
Description: Add a FIEMAP(FIle Extent MAP) ioctl for ldiskfs
Details    : FIEMAP ioctl will allow an application to efficiently fetch the
             extent information of a file. It can be used to map logical blocks
             in a file to physical blocks in the block device.

       * version 3.0.3

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : if the uninit_groups feature is enabled on ldiskfs
Bugzilla   : 13706
Description: e2fsck reports "invalid unused inodes count"
Details    : If a new ldiskfs filesystem is created with the "uninit_groups"
	     feature and only a single inode is created in a group then the
	     "bg_unused_inodes" count is incorrectly updated.  Creating a
	     second inode in that group would update it correctly.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10555

       * version 3.0.1

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6334
Description: Multiple mount protection(MMP) support.
Details    : This feature will protect the filesystem from being mounted more
	     than once simultaneously. It will also protect changes by e2fsprogs
	     to the filesystem if it is mounted. This assumes high importance
	     in a shared storage environment where multiple mounts can severely
	     corrupt the filesystem.
