Description: Linux kernel patch for the Lustre Filesystem
 Lustre is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available
 cluster file system. This release is maintained by Whamcloud, Inc.
 and available from http://wiki.whamcloud.com/
 .
 Lustre servers require a number of patches to the core Linux kernel,
 mostly to export new functions, add features to ext3, and add
 a new locking path to the VFS. This package provides these patches
 for kernel versions 2.6.18, 2.6.21 and 2.6.22 on i386, amd64, powerpc
 and ia64 architectures.
 .
 For Lustre clients, you will also need to build a lustre-modules
 package, using the lustre-source package and module-assistant.

Description: source for Lustre filesystem client kernel modules
 Lustre is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system.
 This release is maintained by Whamcloud, Inc. and available from
 http://wiki.whamcloud.com/
 .
 This package contains the module source. The client kernel modules
 can be built for kernels from 2.6.18 - 2.6.26 from it using
 module-assistant or make-kpkg.

Description: Runtime library for Lustre filesystem utilities
 Lustre is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system.
 This release is maintained by Whamcloud, Inc. and available
 http://wiki.whamcloud.com/
 .
 This package provides a shared library that is used by userspace
 applications to  work with Lustre filesystems. It gives a user application
 linked with the library access to Lustre
 file systems without the need to mount Lustre (VFS) on the client.
 The key goals for the library are to provide a portable mechanism to
 access Lustre from different POSIX compliant operating systems, to provide
 access from microkernel based systems and from the Windows operating system.
 .
 Currently, liblustre is still under development and only works on Linux
 (i386 & x86_64, not tested on ia64).
