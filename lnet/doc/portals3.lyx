\layout Abstract

This report presents a specification for the Portals 3.2 message passing
 interface.
 Portals 3.2 is intended to allow scalable, high-performance network communicatio
n between nodes of a parallel computing system.
 Specifically, it is designed to support a parallel computing platform composed
 of clusters of commodity workstations connected by a commodity system area
 network fabric.
 In addition, Portals 3.2 is well suited to massively parallel processing
 and embedded systems.
 Portals 3.2 represents an adaption of the data movement layer developed
 for massively parallel processing platforms, such as the 4500-node Intel
 TeraFLOPS machine.

Summary of Changes for Version 3.1
\layout Section*

Thread Issues
\layout Standard

The most significant change to the interface from version 3.0 to 3.1 involves
 the clarification of how the interface interacts with multi-threaded applicatio
ns.
 We adopted a generic thread model in which processes define an address
 space and threads share the address space.
 Consideration of the API in the light of threads lead to several clarifications
 throughout the document: 
\layout Enumerate

Glossary: 
\begin_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

added a definition for 
\emph on 
thread
\emph default 
, 
\layout Enumerate

reworded the definition for 
\emph on 
process
\emph default 
.
 
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:apiover}

\end_inset 

: added section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:threads}

\end_inset 

 to describe the multi-threading model used by the Portals API.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ptlinit}

\end_inset 

: 
\emph on 
PtlInit
\emph default 
 must be called at least once and may be called any number of times.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ptlfini}

\end_inset 

: 
\emph on 
PtlFini
\emph default 
 should be called once as the process is terminating and not as each thread
 terminates.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:pid}

\end_inset 

: Portals does not define thread ids.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ni}

\end_inset 

: network interfaces are associated with processes, not threads.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:niinit}

\end_inset 

: 
\emph on 
PtlNIInit
\emph default 
 must be called at least once and may be called any number of times.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:eqget}

\end_inset 

: 
\emph on 
PtlEQGet
\emph default 
 returns 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EQ_EMPTY
\family default 
 if a thread is blocked on 
\emph on 
PtlEQWait
\emph default 
.
 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:eqwait}

\end_inset 

: waiting threads are awakened in FIFO order.
 
\layout Standard

Two functions, 
\emph on 
PtlNIBarrier
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
PtlEQCount
\emph default 
 were removed from the API.
 
\emph on 
PtlNIBarrier
\emph default 
 was defined to block the calling process until all of the processes in
 the application group had invoked 
\emph on 
PtlNIBarrier
\emph default 
.
 We now consider this functionality, along with the concept of groups (see
 the discussion under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

other changes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

), to be part of the runtime system, not part of the Portals API.
 
\emph on 
PtlEQCount
\emph default 
 was defined to return the number of events in an event queue.
 Because external operations may lead to new events being added and other
 threads may remove events, the value returned by 
\emph on 
PtlEQCount
\emph default 
 would have to be a hint about the number of events in the event queue.
\layout Section*

Handling small, unexpected messages
\layout Standard

Another set of changes relates to handling small unexpected messages in
 MPI.
 In designing version 3.0, we assumed that each unexpected message would
 be placed in a unique memory descriptor.
 To avoid the need to process a long list of memory descriptors, we moved
 the memory descriptors out of the match list and hung them off of a single
 match list entry.
 In this way, large unexpected messages would only encounter a single 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

short message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 match list entry before encountering the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

long message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 match list entry.
 Experience with this strategy identified resource management problems with
 this approach.
 In particular, a long sequence of very short (or zero length) messages
 could quickly exhaust the memory descriptors constructed for handling unexpecte
d messages.
 Our new strategy involves the use of several very large memory descriptors
 for small unexpected messages.
 Consecutive unexpected messages will be written into the first of these
 memory descriptors until the memory descriptor fills up.
 When the first of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

small memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 descriptors fills up, it will be unlinked and subsequent short messages
 will be written into the next 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

short message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 memory descriptor.
 In this case, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

short message
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 memory descriptor will be declared full when it does not have sufficient
 space for the largest small unexpected message.
\layout Standard

This lead to two significant changes.
 First, each match list entry now has a single memory descriptor rather
 than a list of memory descriptors.
 Second, in addition to exceeding the operation threshold, a memory descriptor
 can be unlinked when the local offset exceeds a specified value.
 These changes have lead to several changes in this document: 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{subsec:paddress}

\end_inset 

: 
\begin_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

removed references to the memory descriptor list, 
\layout Enumerate

changed the portals address translation description to indicate that unlinking
 a memory descriptor implies unlinking the associated match list entry--match
 list entries can no longer be unlinked independently from the memory descriptor.
 
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:meattach}

\end_inset

\end_inset 

: modified Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:oconsts}

\end_inset 

 to indicate where each constant is introduced and where it is used.
 
\layout Section*

Other changes
\layout Subsection*

Implementation defined limits (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:niinit}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

The earlier version provided implementation defined limits for the maximum
 number of match entries, the maximum number of memory descriptors, etc.
 Rather than spanning the entire implementation, these limits are now associated
 with individual network interfaces.
\layout Subsection*

Added User Ids (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:uid}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

Group Ids had been used to simplify access control entries.
 In particular, a process could allow access for all of the processes in
 a group.
 User Ids have been introduced to regain this functionality.
 We use user ids to fill this role.
\layout Subsection*

Removed Group Ids and Rank Ids (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:pid}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

The earlier version of Portals had two forms for addressing processes: <node
 id, process id> and <group id, rank id>.
 A process group was defined as the collection processes created during
 application launch.
 Each process in the group was given a unique rank id in the range 0 to
 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 was the number of processes in the group.
 We removed groups because they are better handled in the runtime system.
\layout Subsection*

Match lists (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:meattach}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

It is no longer illegal to have an existing match entry when calling PtlMEAttach.
 A position argument was added to the list of arguments supplied to 
\emph on 
PtlMEAttach
\emph default 
 to specify whether the new match entry is prepended or appended to the
 existing list.
 If there is no existing match list, the position argument is ignored.
\layout Subsection*

Unlinking Memory Descriptors (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:md}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

Previously, a memory descriptor could be unlinked if the offset exceeded
 a threshold upon the completion of an operation.
 In this version, the unlinking is delayed until there is a matching operation
 which requires more memory than is currently available in the descriptor.
 In addition to changes in section, this lead to a revision of Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:flow}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection*

Split Phase Operations and Events (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:eq}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

Previously, there were five types of events: 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_PUT
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_GET
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_REPLY
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SENT
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_ACK.
 
\family default 
The first four of these reflected the completion of potentially long operations.
 We have introduced new event types to reflect the fact that long operations
 have a distinct starting point and a distinct completion point.
 Moreover, the completion may be successful or unsuccessful.
\layout Standard

In addition to providing a mechanism for reporting failure to higher levels
 of software, this split provides an opportunity for for improved ordering
 semantics.
 Previously, if one process intiated two operations (e.g., two put operations)
 on a remote process, these operations were guaranteed to complete in the
 same order that they were initiated.
 Now, we only guarantee that the initiation events are delivered in the
 same order.
 In particular, the operations do not need to complete in the order that
 they were intiated.
\layout Subsection*

Well known proces ids (Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:niinit}

\end_inset 

)
\layout Standard

To support the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

well known process ids,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 we added a process id argument to the arguments for PtlNIInit.

Overview
\layout Standard

This document describes an application programming interface for message
 passing between nodes in a system area network.
 The goal of this interface is to improve the scalability and performance
 of network communication by defining the functions and semantics of message
 passing required for scaling a parallel computing system to ten thousand
 nodes.
 This goal is achieved by providing an interface that will allow a quality
 implementation to take advantage of the inherently scalable design of Portals.

Purpose
\layout Standard

Existing message passing technologies available for commodity cluster networking
 hardware do not meet the scalability goals required by the Cplant\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cplant}

\end_inset 

 project at Sandia National Laboratories.
 The goal of the Cplant project is to construct a commodity cluster that
 can scale to the order of ten thousand nodes.
 This number greatly exceeds the capacity for which existing message passing
 technologies have been designed and implemented.
\layout Standard

In addition to the scalability requirements of the network, these technologies
 must also be able to support a scalable implementation of the Message Passing
 Interface (MPI)\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{MPIstandard}

\end_inset 

 standard, which has become the 
\shape italic 
de facto
\shape default 
 standard for parallel scientific computing.
 While MPI does not impose any scalability limitations, existing message
 passing technologies do not provide the functionality needed to allow implement
ations of MPI to meet the scalability requirements of Cplant.
\layout Standard

The following are properties of a network architecture that do not impose
 any inherent scalability limitations: 
\layout Itemize

Connectionless - Many connection-oriented architectures, such as VIA\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{VIA}

\end_inset 

 and TCP/IP sockets, have limitations on the number of peer connections
 that can be established.
 
\layout Itemize

Network independence - Many communication systems depend on the host processor
 to perform operations in order for messages in the network to be consumed.
 Message consumption from the network should not be dependent on host processor
 activity, such as the operating system scheduler or user-level thread scheduler.
 
\layout Itemize

User-level flow control - Many communication systems manage flow control
 internally to avoid depleting resources, which can significantly impact
 performance as the number of communicating processes increases.
 
\layout Itemize

OS Bypass - High performance network communication should not involve memory
 copies into or out of a kernel-managed protocol stack.
 
\layout Standard

The following are properties of a network architecture that do not impose
 scalability limitations for an implementation of MPI:
\layout Itemize

Receiver-managed - Sender-managed message passing implementations require
 a persistent block of memory to be available for every process, requiring
 memory resources to increase with job size and requiring user-level flow
 control mechanisms to manage these resources.
 
\layout Itemize

User-level Bypass - While OS Bypass is necessary for high-performance, it
 alone is not sufficient to support the Progress Rule of MPI asynchronous
 operations.
 
\layout Itemize

Unexpected messages - Few communication systems have support for receiving
 messages for which there is no prior notification.
 Support for these types of messages is necessary to avoid flow control

Background
\layout Standard

Portals was originally designed for and implemented on the nCube machine
 as part of the SUNMOS (Sandia/UNM OS)\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{SUNMOS}

\end_inset 

 and Puma\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{PumaOS}

\end_inset 

 lightweight kernel development projects.
 Portals went through two design phases, the latter of which is used on
 the 4500-node Intel TeraFLOPS machine\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{TFLOPS}

\end_inset 

.
 Portals have been very successful in meeting the needs of such a large
 machine, not only as a layer for a high-performance MPI implementation\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{PumaMPI}

\end_inset 

, but also for implementing the scalable run-time environment and parallel
 I/O capabilities of the machine.
\layout Standard

The second generation Portals implementation was designed to take full advantage
 of the hardware architecture of large MPP machines.
 However, efforts to implement this same design on commodity cluster technology
 identified several limitations, due to the differences in network hardware
 as well as to shortcomings in the design of Portals.
\layout Section

Scalability
\layout Standard

The primary goal in the design of Portals is scalability.
 Portals are designed specifically for an implementation capable of supporting
 a parallel job running on tens of thousands of nodes.
 Performance is critical only in terms of scalability.
 That is, the level of message passing performance is characterized by how
 far it allows an application to scale and not by how it performs in micro-bench
marks (e.g., a two node bandwidth or latency test).
\layout Standard

The Portals API is designed to allow for scalability, not to guarantee it.
 Portals cannot overcome the shortcomings of a poorly designed application
 program.
 Applications that have inherent scalability limitations, either through
 design or implementation, will not be transformed by Portals into scalable
 applications.
 Scalability must be addressed at all levels.
 Portals do not inhibit scalability, but do not guarantee it either.
\layout Standard

To support scalability, the Portals interface maintains a minimal amount
 of state.
 Portals provide reliable, ordered delivery of messages between pairs of
 processes.
 They are connectionless: a process is not required to explicitly establish
 a point-to-point connection with another process in order to communicate.
 Moreover, all buffers used in the transmission of messages are maintained
 in user space.
 The target process determines how to respond to incoming messages, and
 messages for which there are no buffers are discarded.
\layout Section

Communication Model
\layout Standard

Portals combine the characteristics of both one-side and two-sided communication.
 They define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

matching put
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operation and a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

matching get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operation.
 The destination of a put (or send) is not an explicit address; instead,
 each message contains a set of match bits that allow the receiver to determine
 where incoming messages should be placed.
 This flexibility allows Portals to support both traditional one-sided operation
s and two-sided send/receive operations.
\layout Standard

Portals allows the target to determine whether incoming messages are acceptable.
 A target process can choose to accept message operations from any specific
 process or can choose to ignore message operations from any specific process.
\layout Section

Zero Copy, OS Bypass and Application Bypass
\layout Standard

In traditional system architectures, network packets arrive at the network
 interface card (NIC), are passed through one or more protocol layers in
 the operating system, and eventually copied into the address space of the
 application.
 As network bandwidth began to approach memory copy rates, reduction of
 memory copies became a critical concern.
 This concern lead to the development of zero-copy message passing protocols
 in which message copies are eliminated or pipelined to avoid the loss of
 bandwidth.
\layout Standard

A typical zero-copy protocol has the NIC generate an interrupt for the CPU
 when a message arrives from the network.
 The interrupt handler then controls the transfer of the incoming message
 into the address space of the appropriate application.
 The interrupt latency, the time from the initiation of an interrupt until
 the interrupt handler is running, is fairly significant.
 To avoid this cost, some modern NICs have processors that can be programmed
 to implement part of a message passing protocol.
 Given a properly designed protocol, it is possible to program the NIC to
 control the transfer of incoming messages, without needing to interrupt
 the CPU.
 Because this strategy does not need to involve the OS on every message
 transfer, it is frequently called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OS Bypass.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\end_inset 

, GM\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{GM}

\end_inset 

, and Portals are examples of OS Bypass protocols.
\layout Standard

Many protocols that support OS Bypass still require that the application
 actively participate in the protocol to ensure progress.
 As an example, the long message protocol of PM requires that the application
 receive and reply to a request to put or get a long message.
 This complicates the runtime environment, requiring a thread to process
 incoming requests, and significantly increases the latency required to
 initiate a long message protocol.
 The Portals message passing protocol does not require activity on the part
 of the application to ensure progress.
 We use the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Application Bypass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to refer to this aspect of the Portals protocol.
\layout Section

Faults 
\layout Standard

Given the number of components that we are dealing with and the fact that
 we are interested in supporting applications that run for very long times,
 failures are inevitable.
 The Portals API recognizes that the underlying transport may not be able
 to successfully complete an operation once it has been initiated.
 This is reflected in the fact that the Portals API reports three types
 of events: events indicating the initiation of an operation, events indicating
 the successful completion of an operation, and events indicating the unsuccessf
ul completion of an operation.
 Every initiation event is eventually followed by a successful completion
 event or an unsuccessful completion event.
\layout Standard

Between the time an operation is started and the time that the operation
 completes (successfully or unsuccessfully), any memory associated with
 the operation should be considered volatile.
 That is, the memory may be changed in unpredictable ways while the operation
 is progressing.
 Once the operation completes, the memory associated with the operation
 will not be subject to further modification (from this operation).
 Notice that unsuccessful operations may alter memory in an essentially
 unpredictable fashion.

An Overview of the Portals API
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:apiover}

\layout Standard

In this section, we give a conceptual overview of the Portals API.
 The goal is to provide a context for understanding the detailed description
 of the API presented in the next section.
\layout Section

Data Movement
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:dmsemantics}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A Portal represents an opening in the address space of a process.
 Other processes can use a Portal to read (get) or write (put) the memory
 associated with the portal.
 Every data movement operation involves two processes, the 
\series bold 
initiator
\series default 
 and the 
\series bold 
target
\series default 
.
 The initiator is the process that initiates the data movement operation.
 The target is the process that responds to the operation by either accepting
 the data for a put operation, or replying with the data for a get operation.
\layout Standard

In this discussion, activities attributed to a process may refer to activities
 that are actually performed by the process or 
\emph on 
on behalf of the process
\emph default 
.
 The inclusiveness of our terminology is important in the context of 
\emph on 
application bypass
\emph default 
.
 In particular, when we note that the target sends a reply in the case of
 a get operation, it is possible that reply will be generated by another
 component in the system, bypassing the application.
\layout Standard

 and

 present graphical interpretations of the Portal data movement operations:
 put and get.
 In the case of a put operation, the initiator sends a put request message
 containing the data to the target.
 The target translates the Portal addressing information in the request
 using its local Portal structures.
 When the request has been processed, the target optionally sends an acknowledge
ment message.

 Once it has translated the Portal addressing information, the target sends
 a reply that includes the requested data.

We should note that Portal address translations are only performed on nodes

 Acknowledgements and replies to get operations bypass the portals address
 translation structures.

Portal Addressing
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{subsec:paddress}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

One-sided data movement models (e.g., shmem\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{CraySHMEM}

\end_inset 

, ST\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{ST}

\end_inset 

, MPI-2\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{MPI2}

\end_inset 

) typically use a triple to address memory on a remote node.
 This triple consists of a process id, memory buffer id, and offset.
 The process id identifies the target process, the memory buffer id specifies
 the region of memory to be used for the operation, and the offset specifies
 an offset within the memory buffer.
\layout Standard

In addition to the standard address components (process id, memory buffer
 id, and offset), a Portal address includes a set of match bits.
 This addressing model is appropriate for supporting one-sided operations
 as well as traditional two-sided message passing operations.
 Specifically, the Portals API provides the flexibility needed for an efficient
 implementation of MPI-1, which defines two-sided operations with one-sided
 completion semantics.
\layout Standard

Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:portals}

\end_inset 

 presents a graphical representation of the structures used by a target
 in the interpretation of a Portal address.
 The process id is used to route the message to the appropriate node and
 is not reflected in this diagram.
 The memory buffer id, called the 
\series bold 
portal id
\series default 
, is used as an index into the Portal table.
 Each element of the Portal table identifies a match list.
 Each element of the match list specifies two bit patterns: a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

don't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 bits, and a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

must match
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 bits.
 In addition to the two sets of match bits, each match list element has
 at most one memory descriptor.
 Each memory descriptor identifies a memory region and an optional event
 queue.
 The memory region specifies the memory to be used in the operation and
 the event queue is used to record information about these operations.

, the operation (put or get) is performed using the memory region specified
 in the memory descriptor.
 If the memory descriptor specifies that it is to be unlinked when a threshold
 has been exceeded, the match list entry is removed from the match list
 and the resources associated with the memory descriptor and match list
 entry are reclaimed.
 Finally, if there is an event queue specified in the memory descriptor,
 the operation is logged in the event queue.

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{fig:flow}

\layout Standard

If the match criteria specified in the match list entry are not met, or
 there is no memory descriptor associated with the match list entry, or
 the memory descriptor associated with the match list entry rejects the
 operation, the address translation continues with the next match list entry.
 If the end of the match list has been reached, the address translation
 is aborted and the incoming requested is discarded.
\layout Section

Access Control
\layout Standard

A process can control access to its portals using an access control list.
 Each entry in the access control list specifies a process id and a Portal
 table index.
 The access control list is actually an array of entries.
 Each incoming request includes an index into the access control list (i.e.,
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cookie
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or hint).
 If the id of the process issuing the request doesn't match the id specified
 in the access control list entry or the Portal table index specified in
 the request doesn't match the Portal table index specified in the access
 control list entry, the request is rejected.
 Process identifiers and Portal table indexes may include wild card values
 to increase the flexibility of this mechanism.
 
\layout Standard

Two aspects of this design merit further discussion.
 First, the model assumes that the information in a message header, the
 sender's id in particular, is trustworthy.
 In most contexts, we assume that the entity that constructs the header
 is trustworthy; however, using cryptographic techniques, we could easily
 devise a protocol that would ensure the authenticity of the sender.
\layout Standard

Second, because the access check is performed by the receiver, it is possible
 that a malicious process will generate thousands of messages that will
 be denied by the receiver.
 This could saturate the network and/or the receiver, resulting in a 
\emph on 
denial of service
\emph default 
 attack.
 Moving the check to the sender using capabilities, would remove the potential
 for this form of attack.
 However, the solution introduces the complexities of capability management
 (exchange of capabilities, revocation, protections, etc).
\layout Section

Multi-threaded Applications
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:threads}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The Portals API supports a generic view of multi-threaded applications.
 From the perspective of the Portals API, an application program is defined
 by a set of processes.
 Each process defines a unique address space.
 The Portals API defines access to this address space from other processes
 (using portals addressing and the data movement operations).
 A process may have one or more 
\emph on 
threads
\emph default 
 executing in its address space.
 
\layout Standard

With the exception of 
\emph on 
PtlEQWait
\emph default 
 every function in the Portals API is non-blocking and atomic with respect
 to both other threads and external operations that result from data movement
 operations.
 While individual operations are atomic, sequences of these operations may
 be interleaved between different threads and with external operations.
 The Portals API does not provide any mechanisms to control this interleaving.
 It is expected that these mechanisms will be provided by the API used to
 create threads.

 function cleans up after the Portals library is no longer needed by a process.
 After this function is called, calls to any of the functions defined by

 Typically, this function will be called in the exit sequence of a process.
 Individual threads should not call PtlFini when they terminate.

Network Interfaces
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:ni}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The Portals API supports the use of multiple network interfaces.
 However, each interface is treated as an independent entity.
 Combining interfaces (e.g., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

bonding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to create a higher bandwidth connection) must be implemented by the application
 or embedded in the underlying network.
 Interfaces are treated as independent entities to make it easier to cache
 information on individual network interface cards.
\layout Standard

Once initialized, each interface provides a Portal table, an access control
 table, and a collection of status registers.
 See Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:me}

\end_inset 

 for a discussion of updating Portal table entries using the 
\emph on 
PtlMEAttach
\emph default 
 function.
 See Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ac}

\end_inset 

 for a discussion of the initialization and updating of entries in the access
 control table.
 See Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nistatus}

\end_inset 

 for a discussion of the 
\emph on 
PtlNIStatus
\emph default 
 function which can be used to determine the value of a status register.
\layout Standard

Every other type of Portal object (e.g., memory descriptor, event queue, or
 match list entry) is associated with a specific network interface.
 The association to a network interface is established when the object is
 created and is encoded in the handle for the object.
\layout Standard

Each network interface is initialized and shutdown independently.
 The initialization routine, 
\emph on 
PtlNIInit
\emph default 
, returns a handle for an interface object which is used in all subsequent
 Portal operations.
 The 
\emph on 
PtlNIFini
\emph default 
 function is used to shutdown an interface and release any resources that
 are associated with the interface.
 Network interface handles are associated with processes, not threads.
 All threads in a process share all of the network interface handles.
\layout Standard

The Portals API also defines the 
\emph on 
PtlNIStatus
\emph default 
 function to query the status registers for a network interface, the 
\emph on 
PtlNIDist
\emph default 
 function to determine the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Process Identification
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:pid}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Processes that use the Portals API, can be identified using a node id and
 process id.
 Every node accessible through a network interface has a unique node identifier
 and every process running on a node has a unique process identifier.
 As such, any process in the computing system can be identified by its node
 id and process id.
 
\layout Standard

The Portals API defines a type, 
\family typewriter 
ptl_process_id_t
\family default 
 for representing process ids and a function, 
\emph on 
PtlGetId
\emph default 
, which can be used to obtain the id of the current process.
\layout Comment

The portals API does not include thread identifiers.
  Messages are delivered to processes (address spaces) not threads (contexts
 of  execution).

Match List Entries and Match Lists
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:me}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A match list is a chain of match list entries.
 Each match list entry includes a memory descriptor and a set of match criteria.
 The match criteria can be used to reject incoming requests based on process
 id or the match bits provided in the request.
 A match list is created using the 
\emph on 
PtlMEAttach
\emph default 
 or 
\shape italic 
PtlMEAttachAny
\shape default 
 functions, which create a match list consisting of a single match list
 entry, attaches the match list to the specified Portal index, and returns
 a handle for the match list entry.
 Match entries can be dynamically inserted and removed from a match list
 using the 
\emph on 
PtlMEInsert
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
PtlMEUnlink
\emph default 
 functions.

Memory Descriptors
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:md}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A memory descriptor contains information about a region of an application
 process' memory and an event queue where information about the operations
 performed on the memory descriptor are recorded.
 The Portals API provides two operations to create memory descriptors: 
\emph on 
PtlMDAttach
\emph default 
, and 
\emph on 
PtlMDBind
\emph default 
; an operation to update a memory descriptor, 
\emph on 
PtlMDUpdate
\emph default 
; and an operation to unlink and release the resources associated with a
 memory descriptor, 
\emph on 
PtlMDUnlink
\emph default 
.

\noindent 
The 
\family typewriter 
ptl_md_t
\family default 
 type defines the application view of a memory descriptor.
 Values of this type are used to initialize and update the memory descriptors.
\layout Subsubsection

Members
\layout Description

start,\SpecialChar ~
length Specify the memory region associated with the memory descriptor.
 The 
\family typewriter 
start
\family default 
 member specifies the starting address for the memory region and the 
\family typewriter 
length
\family default 
 member specifies the length of the region.
 The 
\family typewriter 
start member
\family default 
 can be NULL provided that the 
\family typewriter 
length
\family default 
 member is zero.
 (Zero length buffers are useful to record events.) There are no alignment
 restrictions on the starting address or the length of the region; although,
 unaligned messages may be slower (i.e., lower bandwidth and/or longer latency)
 on some implementations.
 
\layout Description

threshold Specifies the maximum number of operations that can be performed
 on the memory descriptor.
 An operation is any action that could possibly generate an event (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ek-type}

\end_inset 

 for the different types of events).
 In the usual case, the threshold value is decremented for each operation
 on the memory descriptor.
 When the threshold value is zero, the memory descriptor is 
\emph on 
inactive
\emph default 
, and does not respond to operations.
 A memory descriptor can have an initial threshold value of zero to allow
 for manipulation of an inactive memory descriptor by the local process.
 A threshold value of 
\family typewriter 
PTL_MD_THRESH_INF
\family default 
 indicates that there is no bound on the number of operations that may be
 applied to a memory descriptor.
 Note that local operations (e.g., 
\emph on 
PtlMDUpdate
\emph default 
) are not applied to the threshold count.
 
\layout Description

max_offset Specifies the maximum local offset of a memory descriptor.
 When the local offset of a memory descriptor exceeds this maximum, the
 memory descriptor becomes 
\shape italic 
inactive
\shape default 
 and does not respond to further operations.
\layout Description

options Specifies the behavior of the memory descriptor.
 There are five options that can be selected: enable put operations (yes
 or no), enable get operations (yes or no), offset management (local or
 remote), message truncation (yes or no), and acknowledgement (yes or no).
 Values for this argument can be constructed using a bitwise or of the following
 values: 
\begin_deeper 
\begin_deeper 
\layout Description

PTL_MD_OP_PUT Specifies that the memory descriptor will respond to 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations.
 By default, memory descriptors reject 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations.
 
\layout Description

PTL_MD_OP_GET Specifies that the memory descriptor will respond to 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operations.
 By default, memory descriptors reject 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operations.
 
\layout Description

PTL_MD_MANAGE_REMOTE Specifies that the offset used in accessing the memory
 region is provided by the incoming request.
 By default, the offset is maintained locally.
 When the offset is maintained locally, the offset is incremented by the
 length of the request so that the next operation (put and/or get) will
 access the next part of the memory region.
\layout Description

PTL_MD_TRUNCATE Specifies that the length provided in the incoming request
 can be reduced to match the memory available in the region.
 (The memory available in a memory region is determined by subtracting the
 offset from the length of the memory region.) By default, if the length
 in the incoming operation is greater than the amount of memory available,
 the operation is rejected.
 
\layout Description

PTL_MD_ACK_DISABLE Specifies that an acknowledgement should 
\emph on 
not
\emph default 
 be sent for incoming 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations, even if requested.
 By default, acknowledgements are sent for 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations that request an acknowledgement.
 Acknowledgements are never sent for 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operations.
 The value sent in the reply serves as an implicit acknowledgement.
 
\end_deeper 
\layout Standard

Note
\series default 
: It is not considered an error to have a memory descriptor that does not
 respond to either 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 or 
\emph on

\emph default 
 operations: Every memory descriptor responds to 
\emph on

\emph default 
 operations.
 Nor is it considered an error to have a memory descriptor that responds
 to both 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operations.
 
\end_deeper 
\layout Description

user_ptr A user-specified value that is associated with the memory descriptor.
 The value does not need to be a pointer, but must fit in the space used
 by a pointer.
 This value (along with other values) is recorded in events associated with
 operations on this memory descriptor.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

Tying the memory descriptor to a user-defined value can be useful when multiple
 memory descriptor share the same event queue or when the memory descriptor
 needs to be associated with a data structure maintained by the application.
 For example, an MPI implementation can set the 
\family typewriter 
user_ptr
\family default 
 argument to the value of an MPI Request.
 This direct association allows for processing of memory descriptor's by
 the MPI implementation without a table lookup or a search for the appropriate
 MPI Request.
\end_inset 


\layout Description

eventq A handle for the event queue used to log the operations performed
 on the memory region.
 If this argument is 
\family typewriter 
PTl_EQ_NONE

The conditional update can be used to ensure that the memory descriptor
 has not changed between the time it was examined and the time it is updated.
 In particular, it is needed to support an MPI implementation where the
 activity of searching an unexpected message queue and posting a receive
 must be atomic.
\layout Section

Events and Event Queues
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:eq}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Event queues are used to log operations performed on memory descriptors.
 They can also be used to hold acknowledgements for completed 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations and to note when the data specified in a 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operation has been sent (i.e., when it is safe to reuse the buffer that holds
 this data).
 Multiple memory descriptors can share a single event queue.
\layout Standard

In addition to the 
\family typewriter 
ptl_handle_eq_t
\family default 
 type, the Portals API defines two types associated with events: The 
\family typewriter 

\newline 
ptl_event_kind_t
\family default 
 type defines the kinds of events that can be stored in an event queue.
 The 
\family typewriter 
ptl_event_t
\family default 
 type defines a structure that holds the information associated with an
 event.
\layout Standard

The Portals API also provides four functions for dealing with event queues:
 The 
\emph on 
PtlEQAlloc
\emph default 
 function is used to allocate the API resources needed for an event queue,
 the 
\emph on 
PtlEQFree
\emph default 
 function is used to release these resources, the 
\emph on 
PtlEQGet
\emph default 
 function can be used to get the next event from an event queue, and the
 
\emph on 
PtlEQWait
\emph default 
 function can be used to block a process (or thread) until an event queue
 has at least one event.

The Portals API defines fourteen types of events that can be logged in an
 event queue: 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_GET_START A remote 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operation has been started on the memory descriptor.
 The memory region associated with this descriptor should not be altered
 until the corresponding END or FAIL event is logged.
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_GET_END A previously initiated 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operation completed successfully.
 This event is logged after the reply has been sent by the local node.
 As such, the process could free the memory descriptor once it sees this
 event.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_GET_FAIL A previously initiated 
\emph on 
get
\emph default 
 operation completed unsuccessfully.
 This event is logged after the reply has been sent by the local node.
 As such, the process could free the memory descriptor once it sees this
 event.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_PUT_START A remote 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operation has been started on the memory descriptor.
 The memory region associated with this descriptor should should be considered
 volatile until the corresponding END or FAIL event is logged.
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_PUT_END A previously initiated 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operation completed successfully.
 The underlying layers will not alter the memory (on behalf of this operation)
 once this event has been logged.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_PUT_FAIL A previously initiated 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operation completed unsuccessfully.
 The underlying layers will not alter the memory (on behalf of this operation)
 once this event has been logged.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_REPLY_START A 
\emph on 
reply
\emph default 
 operation has been started on the memory descriptor.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_REPLY_END A previously initiated 
\emph on 
reply
\emph default 
 operation has completed successfully .
 This event is logged after the data (if any) from the reply has been written
 into the memory descriptor.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_REPLY_FAIL A previously initiated 
\emph on 
reply
\emph default 
 operation has completed unsuccessfully.
 This event is logged after the data (if any) from the reply has been written
 into the memory descriptor.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_ACK An 
\emph on 
acknowledgement
\emph default 
 was received.
 This event is logged when the acknowledgement is received 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_SEND_START An outgoing 
\emph on 
send
\emph default 
 operation has been started.
 The memory region associated with this descriptor should not be altered
 until the corresponding END or FAIL event is logged.
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_SEND_END A previously initiated 
\emph on 
send
\emph default 
 operation has completed successfully.
 This event is logged after the entire buffer has been sent and it is safe
 for the application to reuse the buffer.
 
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_SEND_FAIL A previously initiated 
\emph on 
send
\emph default 
 operation has completed unsuccessfully.
 The process can safely manipulate the memory or free the memory descriptor
 once it sees this event.
\layout Description

PTL_EVENT_UNLINK A memory descriptor associated with this event queue has
 been automatically unlinked.
 This event is not generated when a memory descriptor is explicitly unlinked
 by calling 
\shape italic 
PtlMDUnlink
\shape default 
.
 This event does not decrement the threshold count.
\layout Subsection

Event Ordering
\layout Standard

The Portals API guarantees that a when a process initiates two operations
 on a remote process, the operations will be initiated on the remote process
 in the same order that they were initiated on the original process.
 As an example, if process A intitates two 
\emph on 
put
\emph default 
 operations, 
\emph on 
x
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
y
\emph default 
, on process B, the Portals API guarantees that process A will receive the
 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SEND_START
\family default 
 events for 
\emph on 
x
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
y
\emph default 
 in the same order that process B receives the 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_PUT_START
\family default 
 events for 
\emph on 
x
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
y
\emph default 
.
 Notice that the API does not guarantee that the start events will be delivered
 in the same order that process A initiated the 
\emph on 
x
\emph default 
 and 
\emph on 
y
\emph default 
 operations.
 If process A needs to ensure the ordering of these operations, it should
 include code to wait for the initiation of 
\emph on 
x
\emph default 
 before it initiates 
\emph on 
y
\emph default 
.
\layout Subsection

Failure Notification
\layout Standard

Operations may fail to complete successfully; however, unless the node itself
 fails, every operation that is started will eventually complete.
 While an operation is in progress, the memory associated with the operation
 should not be viewed (in the case of a put or a reply) or altered (in the
 case of a send or get).
 Operation completion, whether successful or unsuccessful, is final.
 That is, when an operation completes, the memory associated with the operation
 will no longer be read or altered by the operation.
 A network interface can use the 
\family typewriter 
ptl_ni_fail_t
\family default 
 to define more specific information regarding the failure of the operation
 and record this information in the 
\family typewriter 
ni_fail_type
\family default 
 field of the event.

An event structure includes the following members: 
\layout Description

type Indicates the type of the event.
 
\layout Description

initiator The id of the initiator.
 
\layout Description

portal The Portal table index specified in the request.
 
\layout Description

match_bits A copy of the match bits specified in the request.
 See section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:me}

\end_inset 

 for more information on match bits.
 
\layout Description

rlength The length (in bytes) specified in the request.
 
\layout Description

mlength The length (in bytes) of the data that was manipulated by the operation.
 For truncated operations, the manipulated length will be the number of
 bytes specified by the memory descriptor (possibly with an offset) operation.
 For all other operations, the manipulated length will be the length of
 the requested operation.
 
\layout Description

offset Is the displacement (in bytes) into the memory region that the operation
 used.
 The offset can be determined by the operation (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:datamovement}

\end_inset 

) for a remote managed memory descriptor, or by the local memory descriptor
 (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:md}

\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Description

md_handle Is the handle to the memory descriptor associated with the event.
\layout Description

mem_desc Is the state of the memory descriptor immediately after the event
 has been processed.
 
\layout Description

hdr_data 64 bits of out-of-band user data (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:put}

\layout Description

sequence The sequence number for this event.
 Sequence numbers are unique to each event.
\layout Comment

The 
\emph on 
sequence
\emph default 
 member is the last member and is volatile to support SMP implementations.
 When an event structure is filled in, the

\noindent 
Values of the type 
\family typewriter 
ptl_ack_req_t
\family default 
 are used to control whether an acknowledgement should be sent when the
 operation completes (i.e., when the data has been written to a memory descriptor
 of the 
\family typewriter 
target
\family default 
 process).
 The value 
\family typewriter 
PTL_ACK_REQ
\family default 
 requests an acknowledgement, the value 
\family typewriter 
PTL_NOACK_REQ
\family default 
 requests that no acknowledgement should be generated.
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
PtlPut
\emph default 
 function initiates an asynchronous put operation.
 There are several events associated with a put operation: initiation of
 the send on the local node (
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SEND_START
\family default 
), completion of the send on the local node (
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SEND_END
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SEND_FAIL
\family default 
), and, when the send completes successfully, the receipt of an acknowledgement
 (
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_ACK
\family default 
) indicating that the operation was accepted by the target.
 These events will be logged in the event queue associated with the memory
 descriptor (
\family typewriter 
mem_desc
\family default 
) used in the put operation.
 Using a memory descriptor that does not have an associated event queue
 results in these events being discarded.
 In this case, the application must have another mechanism (e.g., a higher
 level protocol) for determining when it is safe to modify the memory region
 associated with the memory descriptor.

The Semantics of Message Transmission
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:semantics}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The portals API uses four types of messages: put requests, acknowledgements,
 get requests, and replies.
 In this section, we describe the information passed on the wire for each
 type of message.
 We also describe how this information is used to process incoming messages.
\layout Section

Sending Messages
\layout Standard

Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:put-wire}

\end_inset 

 summarizes the information that is transmitted for a put request.
 The first column provides a descriptive name for the information, the second
 column provides the type for this information, the third column identifies
 the source of the information, and the fourth column provides additional
 notes.
 Most information that is transmitted is obtained directly from the 
\emph on 
PtlPut
\emph default 
 operation.
 Notice that the handle for the memory descriptor used in the 
\emph on 
PtlPut
\emph default 
 operation is transmitted even though this value cannot be interpreted by
 the target.
 A value of anything other than 
\family typewriter 
PTL_MD_NONE
\family default 
, is interpreted as a request for an acknowledgement.

 summarizes the information transmitted in an acknowledgement.
 Most of the information is simply echoed from the put request.
 Notice that the initiator and target are obtained directly from the put
 request, but are swapped in generating the acknowledgement.
 The only new piece of information in the acknowledgement is the manipulated
 length which is determined as the put request is satisfied.

Table\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{tab:get-wire}

\end_inset 

 summarizes the information that is transmitted for a get request.
 Like the information transmitted in a put request, most of the information
 transmitted in a get request is obtained directly from the 
\emph on 
PtlGet
\emph default 
 operation.
 Unlike put requests, get requests do not include the event queue handle.
 In this case, the reply is generated whenever the operation succeeds and
 the memory descriptor must not be unlinked until the reply is received.
 As such, there is no advantage to explicitly sending the event queue handle.

 The initiator and target are obtained directly from the get request, but
 are swapped in generating the acknowledgement.
 The only new information in the acknowledgement are the manipulated length

Receiving Messages
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:receiving}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

When an incoming message arrives on a network interface, the communication
 system first checks that the target process identified in the request is
 a valid process that has initialized the network interface (i.e., that the
 target process has a valid Portal table).
 If this test fails, the communication system discards the message and increment
s the dropped message count for the interface.
 The remainder of the processing depends on the type of the incoming message.
 Put and get messages are subject to access control checks and translation
 (searching a match list), while acknowledgement and reply messages bypass
 the access control checks and the translation step.
\layout Standard

Acknowledgement messages include a handle for the memory descriptor used
 in the original 
\emph on 
PtlPut
\emph default 
 operation.
 This memory descriptor will identify the event queue where the event should
 be recorded.
 Upon receipt of an acknowledgement, the runtime system only needs to confirm
 that the memory descriptor and event queue still exist and that there is
 space for another event.
 Should the any of these conditions fail,  the message is simply discarded
 and the dropped message count for the interface is incremented.
 Otherwise, the system builds an acknowledgement event from the information
 in the acknowledgement message and adds it to the event queue.
\layout Standard

Reception of reply messages is also relatively straightforward.
 Each reply message includes a handle for a memory descriptor.
 If this descriptor exists, it is used to receive the message.
 A reply message will be dropped if the memory descriptor identified in
 the request doesn't exist.
 In either of this case, the dropped message count for the interface is
 incremented.
 These are the only reasons for dropping reply messages.
 Every memory descriptor accepts and truncates incoming reply messages,
 eliminating the other potential reasons for rejecting a reply message.
\layout Standard

The critical step in processing an incoming put or get request involves
 mapping the request to a memory descriptor.
 This step starts by using the Portal index in the incoming request to identify
 a list of match entries.
 This list of match entries is searched in order until a match entry is
 found whose match criteria matches the match bits in the incoming request
 and whose memory descriptor accepts the request.
\layout Standard

Because acknowledge and reply messages are generated in response to requests
 made by the process receiving these messages, the checks performed by the
 runtime system for acknowledgements and replies are minimal.
 In contrast, put and get messages are generated by remote processes and
 the checks performed for these messages are more extensive.
 Incoming put or get messages may be rejected because: 
\layout Itemize

the Portal index supplied in the request is not valid; 
\layout Itemize

the cookie supplied in the request is not a valid access control entry;
 
\layout Itemize

the access control entry identified by the cookie does not match the identifier
 of the requesting process; 
\layout Itemize

the access control entry identified by the access control entry does not
 match the Portal index supplied in the request; or 
\layout Itemize

the match bits supplied in the request do not match any of the match entries
 with a memory descriptor that accepts the request.
 
\layout Standard

In all cases, if the message is rejected, the incoming message is discarded
 and the dropped message count for the interface is incremented.
\layout Standard

A memory descriptor may reject an incoming request for any of the following
 reasons: 
\layout Itemize

the 
\family typewriter 
PTL_MD_PUT
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
PTL_MD_GET
\family default 
 option has not been enabled and the operation is put or get, respectively;
 
\layout Itemize

the length specified in the request is too long for the memory descriptor
 and the 
\family typewriter 
PTL_MD_TRUNCATE
\family default 
 option has not been enabled.

\layout Comment

The examples presented in this chapter have not been updated to reflect
 the current API.
\layout Standard

In this section we present several example to illustrate expected usage
 patterns for the Portals 3.2 API.
 The first example describes how to implement parallel servers using the
 features of the Portals 3.2 API.
 This example covers the access control list and the use of remote managed
 offsets.
 The second example presents an approach to dealing with dropped requests.
 This example covers aspects of match lists and memory descriptors.
 The final example covers message reception in MPI.
 This example illustrates more sophisticated uses of matching and a procedure
 to update a memory descriptor.

Parallel File Servers

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Figure\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:file}

\end_inset 

 illustrates the logical structure of a parallel file server.
 In this case, the parallel server consists of four servers that stripe
 application data across four disks.
 We would like to present applications with the illusion that the file server
 is a single entity.
 We will assume that all of the processes that constitute the parallel server
 have the same user id.

Parallel File Server
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{fig:file}

\end_inset 


\end_inset 


\layout Standard

When an application establishes a connection to the parallel file server,
 it will allocate a Portal and access control list entry for communicating
 with the server.
 The access control list entry will include the Portal and match any process
 in the parallel file server's, so all of the file server processes will
 have access to the portal.
 The Portal information and access control entry will be sent to the file
 server at this time.
 If the application and server need to have multiple, concurrent I/O operations,
 they can use additional portals or match entries to keep the operations
 from interfering with one another.
\layout Standard

When an application initiates an I/O operation, it first builds a memory
 descriptor that describes the memory region involved in the operation.
 This memory descriptor will enable the appropriate operation (put for read
 operations and get for write operations) and enable the use of remote offsets
 (this lets the servers decide where their data should be placed in the
 memory region).
 After creating the memory descriptor and linking it into the appropriate
 Portal entry, the application sends a read or write request (using 
\emph on 
PtlPut
\emph default 
) to one of the file server processes.
 The file server processes can then use put or get operations with the appropria
te offsets to fill or retrieve the contents of the application's buffer.
 To know when the operation has completed, the application can add an event
 queue to the memory descriptor and add up the lengths of the remote operations
 until the sum is the size of the requested I/O operation.
\layout Section

Dealing with Dropped Requests
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:exdrop}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If a process does not anticipate unexpected requests, they will be discarded.
 Applications using the Portals API can query the dropped count for the
 interface to determine the number of requests that have been dropped (see
 Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nistatus}

\end_inset 

).
 While this approach minimizes resource consumption, it does not provide
 information that might be critical in debugging the implementation of a
 higher level protocol.
\layout Standard

To keep track of more information about dropped requests, we use a memory
 descriptor that truncates each incoming request to zero bytes and logs
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dropped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operations in an event queue.
 Note that the operations are not dropped in the Portals sense, because
 the operation succeeds.
\layout Standard

The following code fragment illustrates an implementation of this approach.
 In this case, we assume that a thread is launched to execute the function
 
\family typewriter 
watch_drop
\family default 
.
 This code starts by building an event queue to log truncated operations
 and a memory descriptor to truncate the incoming requests.
 This example only captures 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dropped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 requests for a single portal.
 In a more realistic situation, the memory descriptor would be appended
 to the match list for every portal.
 We also assume that the thread is capable of keeping up with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dropped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 requests.
 If this is not the case, we could use a finite threshold on the memory
 descriptor to capture the first few dropped requests.

Message Transmission in MPI
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:exmpi}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

We conclude this section with a fairly extensive example that describes
 an approach to implementing message transmission for MPI.
 Like many MPI implementations, we distinguish two message transmission
 protocols: a short message protocol and a long message protocol.
 We use the constant 
\family typewriter 
MPI_LONG_LENGTH
\family default 
 to determine the size of a long message.
\layout Standard

For small messages, the sender simply sends the message and presumes that
 the message will be received (i.e., the receiver has allocated a memory region
 to receive the message body).
 For large messages, the sender also sends the message, but does not presume
 that the message body will be saved.
 Instead, the sender builds a memory descriptor for the message and enables
 get operations on this descriptor.
 If the target does not save the body of the message, it will record an
 event for the put operation.
 When the process later issues a matching MPI receive, it will perform a
 get operation to retrieve the body of the message.
\layout Standard

To facilitate receive side matching based on the protocol, we use the most
 significant bit in the match bits to indicate the protocol: 1 for long
 messages and 0 for short messages.
\layout Standard

The following code presents a function that implements the send side of
 the protocol.
 The global variable 
\family typewriter 
EndGet
\family default 
 is the last match entry attached to the Portal index used for posting long
 messages.
 This entry does not match any incoming requests (i.e., the memory descriptor
 rejects all get operations) and is built during initialization of the MPI
 library.
 The other global variable, 
\family typewriter 
MPI_NI
\family default 
, is a handle for the network interface used by the MPI implementation.

\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
MPISend
\emph default 
 function returns as soon as the message has been scheduled for transmission.
 The event queue argument, 
\family typewriter 
eventq
\family default 
, can be used to determine the disposition of the message.
 Assuming that 
\family typewriter 
eventq
\family default 
 is not 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EQ_NONE
\family default 
, a 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_SENT
\family default 
 event will be recorded for each message as the message is transmitted.
 For small messages, this is the only event that will be recorded in 
\family typewriter 
eventq
\family default 
.
 In contrast, long messages include an explicit request for an acknowledgement.
 If the 
\family typewriter 
target
\family default 
 process has posted a matching receive, the acknowledgement will be sent
 as the message is received.
 If a matching receive has not been posted, the message will be discarded
 and no acknowledgement will be sent.
 When the 
\family typewriter 
target
\family default 
 process later issues a matching receive, the receive will be translated
 into a get operation and a 
\family typewriter 
PTL_EVENT_GET
\family default 
 event will be recorded in 
\family typewriter 
eventq
\family default 
.

 illustrates the organization of the match list used for receiving MPI messages.
 The initial entries (not shown in this figure) would be used to match the
 MPI receives that have been preposted by the application.
 The preposted receives are followed by a match entry, 
\emph on 
RcvMark
\emph default 
, that marks the boundary between preposted receives and the memory descriptors
 used for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 messages.
 The 
\emph on 
RcvMark
\emph default 
 entry is followed by a small collection of match entries that match unexpected
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

short
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 messages, i.e., messages that have a 0 in the most significant bit of their
 match bits.
 The memory descriptors associated with these match entries will append
 the incoming message to the associated memory descriptor and record an
 event in an event queue for unexpected messages.
 The unexpected short message matching entries are followed by a match entry
 that will match messages that were not matched by the preceding match entries,
 i.e., the unexpected long messages.
 The memory descriptor associated with this match entry truncates the message
 body and records an event in the event queue for unexpected messages.
 Note that of the memory descriptors used for unexpected messages share
 a common event queue.
 This makes it possible to process the unexpected messages in the order
 in which they arrived, regardless of.

Message Reception in MPI
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{fig:mpi}

\end_inset 


\end_inset 


\layout Standard

When the local MPI process posts an MPI receive, we must first search the
 events unexpected message queue to see if a matching message has already
 arrived.
 If no matching message is found, a match entry for the receive is inserted
 before the 
\emph on 
RcvMark
\emph default 
 entry--after the match entries for all of the previously posted receives
 and before the match entries for the unexpected messages.
 This ensures that preposted receives are matched in the order that they
 were posted (a requirement of MPI).
 
\layout Standard

While this strategy respects the temporal semantics of MPI, it introduces
 a race condition: a matching message might arrive after the events in the
 unexpected message queue have been searched, but before the match entry
 for the receive has been inserted in the match list.
 
\layout Standard

To avoid this race condition we start by setting the 
\family typewriter 
threshold
\family default 
 of the memory descriptor to 0, making the descriptor inactive.
 We then insert the match entry into the match list and proceed to search
 the events in the unexpected message queue.
 A matching message that arrives as we are searching the unexpected message
 queue will not be accepted by the memory descriptor and, if not matched
 by an earlier match list element, will add an event to the unexpected message
 queue.
 After searching the events in the unexpected message queue, we update the
 memory descriptor, setting the threshold to 1 to activate the memory descriptor.
 This update is predicated by the condition that the unexpected message
 queue is empty.
 We repeat the process of searching the unexpected message queue until the
 update succeeds.
\layout Standard

The following code fragment illustrates this approach.
 Because events must be removed from the unexpected message queue to be
 examined, this code fragment assumes the existence of a user managed event
 list, 
\family typewriter 
Rcvd
\family default 
, for the events that have already been removed from the unexpected message
 queue.
 In an effort to keep the example focused on the basic protocol, we have
 omitted the code that would be needed to manage the memory descriptors
 used for unexpected short messages.
 In particular, we simply leave messages in these descriptors until they
 are received by the application.
 In a robust implementation, we would introduce code to ensure that short
 unexpected messages are removed from these memory descriptors so that they
 can be re-used.
