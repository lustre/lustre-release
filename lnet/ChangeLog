Description: Fixing deadlock in usocklnd
Details    : A deadlock was possible in usocklnd due to race condition while
             tearing connection down. The problem resulted from erroneous
             assumption that lnet_finalize() could have been called holding
             some lnd-level locks.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 13621, 15983
Description: Protocol V2 of o2iblnd
Details    : o2iblnd V2 has several new features:
             . map-on-demand: map-on-demand is disabled by default, it can
	       be enabled by using modparam "map_on_demand=@value@", @value@
	       should >= 0 and < 256, 0 will disable map-on-demand, any other
	       valid value will enable map-on-demand. 
	       Oi2blnd will create FMR or physical MR for RDMA if fragments of
	       RD > @value@.
	       Enable map-on-demand will take less memory for new connection,
	       but a little more CPU for RDMA.
	     . iWARP : to support iWARP, please enable map-on-demand, 32 and 64
	       are recommanded value. iWARP will probably fail for value >=128.
	     . OOB NOOP message: to resolve deadlock on router.
	     . tunable peer_credits_hiw: (high water to return credits),
	       default value of peer_credits_hiw equals to (peer_credits -1),
	       user can change it between peer_credits/2 and (peer_credits - 1).
	       Lower value is recommended for high latency network.
	     . tunable message queue size: it always equals to peer_credits,
	       higher value is recommended for high latency network.
	     . It's compatible with earlier version of o2iblnd

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 18414
Description: Fixing 'running out of ports' issue
Details    : Add a delay before next reconnect attempt in ksocklnd in
             the case of lost race. Limit the frequency of query-requests
             in lnet. Improved handling of 'dead peer' notifications in

	     uniformed to have prototypes similar to kernel ones. Minor
	     cosmetic changes in usocklnd to use cfs_socket_t as
	     representation of socket.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 11245
Description: IB path MTU mistakenly set to 1st path MTU when ib_mtu is off
Details    : See comment 46 in bug 11245 for details - it's indeed a bug
	     introduced by the original 11245 fix.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 15984
Description: uptllnd credit overflow fix
Details    : kptl_msg_t::ptlm_credits could be overflown by uptllnd since
	     it is only a __u8.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 14634
Description: socklnd protocol version 3
Details    : With current protocol V2, connections on router can be
	     blocked and can't receive any incoming messages when there is no
	     more router buffer, so ZC-ACK can't be handled (LNet message
	     can't be finalized) and will cause deadlock on router.
	     Protocol V3 has a dedicated connection for emergency messages
	     like ZC-ACK to router, messages on this dedicated connection
	     don't need any credit so will never be blocked. Also, V3 can send
	     keepalive ping in specified period for router healthy checking.

	     https://bugs.openfabrics.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355
	     if extra Module.symvers is not supported in kernel, we will
	     have to run the script in bug 12316 to update
	     $LINUX/module.symvers before building o2iblnd.
	     More details about this are in bug 12316.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Description: Ptllnd didn't init kptllnd_data.kptl_idle_txs before it could be
	     possibly accessed in kptllnd_shutdown. Ptllnd should init 
	     kptllnd_data.kptl_ptlid2str_lock before calling kptllnd_ptlid2str.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : rare
Description: gmlnd ignored some transmit errors when finalizing lnet messages.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Description: ptllnd logs a piece of incorrect debug info in kptllnd_peer_handle_hello.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Description: the_lnet.ln_finalizing was not set when the current thread is
	     about to complete messages. It only affects multi-threaded 
	     user space LNet.

Description: Assertion failure in kernel ptllnd caused by posting passive
	     bulk buffers before connection establishment complete.
	
Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 12445
Description: A race in kernel ptllnd between deleting a peer and posting
	     new communications for it could hang communications -
	     manifesting as "Unexpectedly long timeout" messages.
	
Severity   : major

Bugzilla   : 12237
Description: Enable lctl's peer_list for MXLND

Severity   : major
Frequency  : after Ptllnd timeouts and portals congestion
Bugzilla   : 11659
Description: Credit overflows
Details    : This was a bug in ptllnd connection establishment.  The fix
	     implements better peer stamps to disambiguate connection
	     establishment and ensure both peers enter the credit flow
	     state machine consistently.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare	
Bugzilla   : 11394
Description: kptllnd didn't propagate some network errors up to LNET 
Details    : This bug was spotted while investigating 11394.  The fix
	     ensures network errors on sends and bulk transfers are
	     propagated to LNET/lustre correctly.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10316
Description: Fixed console chatter in case of -ETIMEDOUT.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11684
Description: Added D_NETTRACE for recording network packet history
	     (initially only for ptllnd).  Also a separate userspace
	     ptllnd facility to gather history which should really be
	     covered by D_NETTRACE too, if only CDEBUG recorded history in
	     userspace.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare	
Bugzilla   : 11616
Description: o2iblnd handle early RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED.
Details    : If the fabric is lossy, an RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED
	     callback can occur before a connection has actually been
	     established.  This caused an assertion failure previously.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11094
Description: Multiple instances for o2iblnd
Details    : Allow multiple instances of o2iblnd to enable networking over
	     multiple HCAs and routing between them.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 11201
Description: lnet deadlock in router_checker
Details    : turned ksnd_connd_lock, ksnd_reaper_lock, and ksock_net_t:ksnd_lock
	     into BH locks to eliminate potential deadlock caused by
	     ksocknal_data_ready() preempting code holding these locks.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 11126
Description: Millions of failed socklnd connection attempts cause a very slow FS
Details    : added a new route flag ksnr_scheduled to distinguish from
	     ksnr_connecting, so that a peer connection request is only turned
	     down for race concerns when an active connection to the same peer
	     is under progress (instead of just being scheduled).

       * bug fixes

Severity   : major on XT3
Bugzilla   : none
Description: libcfs overwrites /proc/sys/portals
Details    : libcfs created a symlink from /proc/sys/portals to
	     /proc/sys/lnet for backwards compatibility.  This is no
	     longer required and makes the Cray portals /proc variables
	     inaccessible.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 11312
Description: OFED FMR API change
Details    : This changes parameter usage to reflect a change in
	     ib_fmr_pool_map_phys() between OFED 1.0 and OFED 1.1.  Note
	     that FMR support is only used in experimental versions of the
	     o2iblnd - this change does not affect standard usage at all.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11245
Description: new ko2iblnd module parameter: ib_mtu
Details    : the default IB MTU of 2048 performs badly on 23108 Tavor
	     HCAs.  You can avoid this problem by setting the MTU to 1024
	     using this module parameter.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11118/11620
Description: ptllnd small request message buffer alignment fix
Details    : Set the PTL_MD_LOCAL_ALIGN8 option on small message receives.
	     Round up small message size on sends in case this option
	     is not supported.  11620 was a defect in the initial
	     implementation which effectively asserted all peers had to be
	     running the correct protocol version which was fixed by always
	     NAK-ing such requests and handling any misalignments they
	     introduce.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rarely
Description: When kib(nal|lnd)_del_peer() is called upon a peer whose
	     ibp_tx_queue is not empty, kib(nal|lnd)_destroy_peer()'s
	     'LASSERT(list_empty(&peer->ibp_tx_queue))' will fail.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11250
Description: Patchless ZC(zero copy) socklnd
Details    : New protocol for socklnd, socklnd can support zero copy without
	     kernel patch, it's compatible with old socklnd. Checksum is 
	     moved from tunables to modparams.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rarely
Description: When ksocknal_del_peer() is called upon a peer whose
	     ksnp_tx_queue is not empty, ksocknal_destroy_peer()'s
	     'LASSERT(list_empty(&peer->ksnp_tx_queue))' will fail.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : when ptlrpc is under heavy use and runs out of request buffer
Bugzilla   : 11318
Description: In lnet_match_blocked_msg(), md can be used without holding a
	     ref on it.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : very rarely
Bugzilla   : 10727
Description: If ksocknal_lib_setup_sock() fails, a ref on peer is lost.
	     If connd connects a route which has been closed by
	     ksocknal_shutdown(), ksocknal_create_routes() may create new
	     routes which hold references on the peer, causing shutdown
	     process to wait for peer to disappear forever.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11234
Description: Dump XT3 portals traces on kptllnd timeout
Details    : Set the kptllnd module parameter "ptltrace_on_timeout=1" to
	     dump Cray portals debug traces to a file.  The kptllnd module
	     parameter "ptltrace_basename", default "/tmp/lnet-ptltrace",
	     is the basename of the dump file.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : infrequent
Bugzilla   : 11308
Description: kernel ptllnd fix bug in connection re-establishment
Details    : Kernel ptllnd could produce protocol errors e.g. illegal
	     matchbits and/or violate the credit flow protocol when trying
	     to re-establish a connection with a peer after an error or
	     timeout. 

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10316
Description: Allow /proc/sys/lnet/debug to be set symbolically
Details    : Allow debug and subsystem debug values to be read/set by name
	     in addition to numerically, for ease of use.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : only in configurations with LNET routers
Bugzilla   : 10316
Description: routes automatically marked down and recovered
Details    : In configurations with LNET routers if a router fails routers
	     now actively try to recover routes that are down, unless they
	     are marked down by an administrator.

Severity   : critical
Frequency  : very rarely, in configurations with LNET routers and TCP
Bugzilla   : 10889
Description: incorrect data written to files on OSTs
Details    : In certain high-load conditions incorrect data may be written
	     to files on the OST when using TCP networks.

2005-10-10  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
	* Configuration change for the XT3
	     The PTLLND is now used to run Lustre over Portals on the XT3.
	     The configure option(s) --with-cray-portals are no longer
	     used.  Rather --with-portals=<path-to-portals-includes> is
	     used to enable building on the XT3.  In addition to enable
	     XT3 specific features the option --enable-cray-xt3 must be
	     used.

2005-10-10  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
	* Portals has been removed, replaced by LNET.
	   LNET is new networking infrastructure for Lustre, it includes a
	   reorganized network configuration mode (see the user
	   documentation for full details) as well as support for routing
	   between different network fabrics.  Lustre Networking Devices
	   (LNDS) for the supported network fabrics have also been created
	   for this new infrastructure.

2005-08-08  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
       * version 1.4.4
       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare (large Voltaire clusters only)
Bugzilla   : 6993
Description: the default number of reserved transmit descriptors was too low
	     for some large clusters
Details    : As a workaround, the number was increased.  A proper fix includes
	     a run-time tunable.

2005-06-02  Cluster File Systems, Inc. <info@clusterfs.com>
       * version 1.4.3
       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : occasional (large-scale events, cluster reboot, network failure)
Bugzilla   : 6411
Description: too many error messages on console obscure actual problem and
	     can slow down/panic server, or cause recovery to fail repeatedly
Details    : enable rate-limiting of console error messages, and some messages
	     that were console errors now only go to the kernel log

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 1693
Description: add /proc/sys/portals/catastrophe entry which will report if
	     that node has previously LBUGged

2005-02-04  Eric Barton  <eeb@bartonsoftware.com>

	* Landed portals:b_port_step as follows...

	  - removed CFS_DECL_SPIN* 
	    just use 'spinlock_t' and initialise with spin_lock_init()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_MUTEX*
	    just use 'struct semaphore' and initialise with init_mutex()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_RWSEM*
	    just use 'struct rw_semaphore' and initialise with init_rwsem()

	  - renamed cfs_sleep_chan -> cfs_waitq
	            cfs_sleep_link -> cfs_waitlink

	  - fixed race in linux version of arch-independent socknal
	    (the ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision).

	  - Didn't fix problems in Darwin version of arch-independent socknal
	    (resetting socket callbacks, eager ack hack, ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision)

	  - removed libcfs types from non-socknal header files (only some types
	    in the header files had been changed; the .c files hadn't been
	    updated at all).
