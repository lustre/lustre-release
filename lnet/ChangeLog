Details    : o2iblnd depends on OFED's modules, if out-tree OFED's modules
             are installed (other than kernel's in-tree infiniband), there
             could be some problem while insmod o2iblnd (mismatch CRC of

             If extra Module.symvers is supported in kernel (i.e, 2.6.17),
             this link provides solution:
             https://bugs.openfabrics.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355
             if extra Module.symvers is not supported in kernel, we will

       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : occasional (large-scale events, cluster reboot, network failure)
Bugzilla   : 6411
Description: too many error messages on console obscure actual problem and
	     can slow down/panic server, or cause recovery to fail repeatedly
Details    : enable rate-limiting of console error messages, and some messages
	     that were console errors now only go to the kernel log

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 1693
Description: add /proc/sys/portals/catastrophe entry which will report if
	     that node has previously LBUGged

	* Landed portals:b_port_step as follows...

	  - removed CFS_DECL_SPIN* 
	    just use 'spinlock_t' and initialise with spin_lock_init()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_MUTEX*
	    just use 'struct semaphore' and initialise with init_mutex()

	  - removed CFS_DECL_RWSEM*
	    just use 'struct rw_semaphore' and initialise with init_rwsem()

	  - renamed cfs_sleep_chan -> cfs_waitq
	            cfs_sleep_link -> cfs_waitlink

          - fixed race in linux version of arch-independent socknal
  	    (the ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision).

	  - Didn't fix problems in Darwin version of arch-independent socknal
 	    (resetting socket callbacks, eager ack hack, ENOMEM/EAGAIN decision)

	  - removed libcfs types from non-socknal header files (only some types
	    in the header files had been changed; the .c files hadn't been
	    updated at all).
